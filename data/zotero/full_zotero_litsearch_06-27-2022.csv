However, documented patterns are often based on samples from spatially/geographically separated locations or sites. Here, we define sampling volume as spatial scale and examine (by Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing) microbial community composition over a scale of 1 mL to 10 L in an acid mine drainage. beta-Diversity analysis revealed that all samples grouped very tightly according to spatial scales and variations between every two scales were significant. Notably, mean beta-diversity within each group was negatively correlated with spatial scales, indicating patchy microbial distribution. Partition of beta-diversity further revealed that it was the relative abundances of some microbial taxa that largely changed among spatial scales. Phylogenetic analysis showed that microbial lineages were not randomly distributed, but displayed a tendency of more phylogenetically clustering at smaller spatial scales. Thus, we documented fine-scale spatial patterns in microbial community composition within a continuous aquatic environment, which may have practical implications for adequate sampling of aquatic systems in future studies.","2017-10","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-07-19 19:19:47","","","","10","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; beta diversity; biome-water; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the last decade, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has replaced these techniques, but the time-consuming and complex nature of high-throughput techniques is a potential bottleneck for full-scale anaerobic digestion application, when monitoring community dynamics. Here, the bacterial and archaeal TRFLP profiles were compared with 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiles (Illumina platform) of 25 full-scale anaerobic digestion plants. The a-diversity analysis revealed a higher richness based on Illumina data, compared with the TRFLP data. This coincided with a clear difference in community organisation, Pareto distribution, and co-occurrence network statistics, i.e., betweenness centrality and normalised degree. The beta-diversity analysis showed a similar clustering profile for the Illumina, bacterial TRFLP and archaeal TRFLP data, based on different distance measures and independent of phylogenetic identification, with pH and temperature as the two key operational parameters determining microbial community composition. The combined knowledge of temporal dynamics and projected clustering in the beta-diversity profile, based on the TRFLP data, distinctly showed that TRFLP is a reliable technique for swift microbial community dynamics screening in full-scale anaerobic digestion plants.","2018-11-14","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-06-30 17:04:05","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In term infants, the microbiome immediately following birth across multiple body sites corresponds to birth mode, with increased Bacteroides in vaginally delivered infants. We aimed to determine the impact of birth mode of the preterm gut microbiome over the first 100 days of life and following neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge. In total, 867 stool samples from 46 preterm infants (21 cesarean and 25 vaginal), median gestational age 27 weeks, were sequenced (V4 region 16S rRNA gene, Illumina MiSeq). Of these, 776 samples passed quality filtering and were included in the analysis. The overall longitudinal alpha-diversity and within infant beta-diversity was comparable between cesarean and vaginally delivered infants. Vaginally delivered infants kept significantly more OTUs from 2 months of life and following NICU discharge, but OTUs lost, gained, and regained were not different based on birth mode. Furthermore, the temporal progression of dominant genera was comparable between birth modes and no significant difference was found for any genera following adjustment for covariates. Lastly, preterm gut community types (PGCTs) showed some moderate differences in very early life, but progressed toward a comparable pattern by week 5. No PGCT was significantly associated with cesarean or vaginal birth. Unlike term infants, birth mode was not significantly associated with changes in microbial diversity, composition, specific taxa, or overall microbial development in preterm infants. This may result from the dominating effects of NICU exposures including the universal use of antibiotics immediately following birth and/or the lack of Bacteroides colonizing preterm infants.","2017-06-06","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-07-19 14:43:19","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-birth mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LC decreased pH more than AZ did in the cecum (both compared to CTR). Beta diversity analysis showed that community structure was distinctly different among the CTR. LC, and AZ treatments, indicating that either LC or AZ treatment modulated the piglet microbiota. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria dominated the community [>98% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs)] in piglet cecal contents. Compared to CTR, both LC, and AZ increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes while they decreased the count of Firmicutes and AZ decreased the population of Proteobacteria. In CTR the top four abundant genera were Prevotella (similar to 10.4%), Succinivibrio (similar to 6.2%), Lactobacillus (similar to 5.6%), and Anaerovibrio (5.4%). Both LC and AZ increased the relative abundance of Prevotella but decreased the ratio of Lactobacillus when they compared with CTR. Moreover, LC increased the relative abundance of Succinivibrio and Anaerovibrio while AZ decreased them. The microbial function prediction showed LC enriched more pathways in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins than CTR or AZ did. LC may potentially function as an alternative to feed-grade antibiotics in weaned piglets due to its beneficial regulation of the intestinal microbiome.","2017-11-07","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-06-30 20:20:16","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-pig gut; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biological studies of the Malaysian hot springs are rare because of the lack of comprehensive information on their microbial communities. In this study, we report a cultivation-independent census to describe microbial communities in six hot springs. The Ulu Slim (US), Sungai Klah (SK), Dusun Tua (DT), Sungai Serai (SS), Semenyih (SE), and Ayer Hangat (AH) hot springs exhibit circumneutral pH with temperatures ranging from 43 degrees C to 90 degrees C. Genomic DNA was extracted from environmental samples and the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that microbial richness was high in all samples as indicated by the detection of 6,334-26,244 operational taxonomy units. In total, 59, 61, 72, 73, 65, and 52 bacterial phyla were identified in the US, SK, DT, SS, SE, and AH hot springs, respectively. Generally, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated the bacterial communities in all hot springs. Archaeal communities mainly consisted of Crenarchaeota, Euryarchaeota, and Parvarchaeota. In beta diversity analysis, the hot spring microbial memberships were clustered primarily on the basis of temperature and salinity. Canonical correlation analysis to assess the relationship between the microbial communities and physicochemical variables revealed that diversity patterns were best explained by a combination of physicochemical variables, rather than by individual abiotic variables such as temperature and salinity.","2017-07-06","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-07-19 15:30:55","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we analyze bacterioplankton and archaeoplankton communities at several taxonomic levels and spatial extents (i.e., North versus South Bay) to reveal patterns in alpha and beta diversity. We assess communities using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in 177 water column samples collected along a 150-km transect over a 2-year monthly time-series. In North Bay, the microbial community is strongly structured by spatial salinity changes while in South Bay seasonal variations dominate community dynamics. Along the steep salinity gradient in North Bay, we find that operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 97% identity) have higher site specificity than at coarser taxonomic levels and turnover (”species” replacement) is high, revealing a distinct brackish community (in oligo-, meso-, and polyhaline samples) from fresh and marine end-members. At coarser taxonomic levels (e.g., phylum, class), taxa are broadly distributed across salinity zones (i.e., present/abundant in a large number of samples) and brackish communities appear to be a mix of fresh and marine communities. We also observe variations in brackish communities between samples with similar salinities, likely related to differences in water residence times between North and South Bay. Throughout SFB, suspended particulate matter is positively correlated with richness and influences changes in beta diversity. Within several abundant groups, including the SAR11 clade (comprising up to 30% of reads in a sample), OTUs appear to be specialized to a specific salinity range. Some other organisms also showed pronounced seasonal abundance, including Synechococcus, Ca. Actinomarina, and Nitrosopumilus-like OTUs. Overall, this study represents the first in-depth spatiotemporal survey of SFB microbial communities and provides insight into how planktonic microorganisms have specialized to different niches along the salinity gradient.","2021-04","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-06-30 19:03:22","","601-616","","3","81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Samples collected from the epipelagic, oxygen minimum and bathypelagic zones were analysed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing. In contrast to previous studies, we found high taxonomic richness in surface and deep water samples, but generally low richness for OMZ communities. Beta-diversity analysis revealed significant dissimilarity between the three water depths. Most microbial communities were dominated by marine Gammaproteobacteria, with strikingly low levels of picocyanobacteria. Community composition was strongly influenced by specific environmental factors including depth, salinity, and the availability of both oxygen and light. Carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycling capacity in the SIO was linked to several autotrophic and copiotrophic Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Taken together, our data suggest that the environmental conditions in the Agulhas Current system, particularly depth-related parameters, substantially influence microbial community structure. In addition, the capacity for biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and sulfur is linked primarily to the dominant Gammaproteobacteria taxa, whereas ecologically rare taxa drive carbon cycling.","2018-07-12","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-06-30 16:56:35","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Monitoring of the anaerobic digestion microbiome can either take place via a nontargeted holistic evaluation of the microbial community through fingerprinting or by targeted monitoring of selected taxa. Here, we compared four different microbial community fingerprinting methods, i.e., amplicon sequencing, metaproteomics, metabolomics and cytomics, in their ability to characterise the full-scale anaerobic digestion microbiome. Cytometric fingerprinting through cytomics reflects a, for anaerobic digestion, novel, single cell-based approach of direct microbial community fingerprinting by flow cytometry. Three different digester types, i.e., sludge digesters, digesters treating agro-industrial waste and dry anaerobic digesters, each reflected different operational parameters. The alpha-diversity analysis yielded inconsistent results, especially for richness, across the different methods. In contrast, beta-diversity analysis resulted in comparable profiles, even when translated into phyla or functions, with clear separation of the three digester types. In-depth analysis of each method's features i.e., operational taxonomic units, metaproteins, metabolites, and cytometric traits, yielded certain similar features, yet, also some clear differences between the different methods, which was related to the complexity of the anaerobic digestion process. In conclusion, cytometric fingerprinting through flow cytometry is a reliable, fast method for holistic monitoring of the anaerobic digestion microbiome, and the complementary identification of key features through other methods could give rise to a direct interpretation of anaerobic digestion process performance.","2021-09-01","2022-06-27 16:28:41","2022-07-18 22:07:42","","","","","202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work investigates the root bacterial community of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and its potential effects on host plant productivity.

Large-scale association analysis identified the potential beneficial bacteria correlated with plant high productivity. Besides, the functional prediction revealed specific pathways enriched in foxtail millet rhizoplane bacterial community.

This study evaluated the effects of a commercial, oral attenuated L. intracellularis vaccination (Enterisol(R) Ileitis) on the intestinal microbial community of weaned piglets. Piglets were experimentally vaccinated with different doses of the L. intracellularis vaccine, and the gut microbial shifts were measured at weeks 0 and 6 post-vaccination. The data presented here demonstrated that oral vaccination against L. intracellularis shapes the gut microbiota in weaned piglets. Alpha diversity analysis revealed that vaccination led to significant changes in species evenness but no changes in species richness of the gut microbiota. Beta diversity analysis revealed that vaccination against L. intracellularis caused a shift in the microbial community structure. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in the intestinal microbiota of piglets regardless of treatment group and time points. At the genus level, there was a significant increase in Streptococcus and a significant decrease in Clostridium in the fecal microbiota of vaccinated pigs, regardless of the dose. Overall, this study sheds a new light on the potential role of the pig microbiota in modulating vaccine responses. Lawsoniaintracellularis, which causes porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE), is a common swine intestinal pathogen that is prevalent in pig production sites worldwide. In this study, the alteration in the microbiome composition of weaned pigs was investigated in response to vaccination against L. intracellularis, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of 64 crossbred (Duroc x [Landrace x Yorkshire]) healthy weanling pigs weaned at 4 weeks of age were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (four pigs/pen; four pens/treatment), using a randomized complete block design for the 42-day trial. Pigs in the treatment groups were orally administered with three different doses (1 dose = 2 mL) of vaccine against L. intracellularis (Enterisol(R) Ileitis, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica GmbH), namely the following: LAW1 (0.5 dose), LAW2 (1 dose), LAW3 (2 dose). A non-vaccinated group served as a negative control (CONT). Alpha diversity analysis revealed that vaccination led to significant changes in species evenness but not species richness of the gut microbiota.

Results demonstrated that physical and chemical variability (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH) were significantly related to divergence in the beta diversity of surface and bottom-water microbial communities. Despite its correlation to microbial community structure in unconstrained analyses, constrained analyses demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was not strongly related to microbial community structure among or within lakes.

Three- and eighteen-month old female mice were fed standard mouse diets for 4 months, each with or without BC (1% w/w) supplementation (n = 3 in each treatment group, 12 in total). We then assessed gut microbiome profiles using 16S sequencing of their feces. Old mice had a less diverse microbiome community compared to young mice and there was a remarkable age-related difference in microbiome composition in the beta diversity analysis. BC supplementation did not significantly affect alpha or beta diversity. The relative abundance of several phyla, including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Tenericutes, was lower in old mice. BC downregulated Firmicutes abundance in young mice and upregulated Bacteroidetes in both age groups, leading to a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. There were age-specific differences in the effect of BC supplementation on the microbiome. Twenty-four operational taxonomic units showed a significant interaction between age and BC supplementation (p < 0.01), which suggests that the ecosystem and the host health status affect the functions and efficiency of BC intake. These results indicate that BC supplementation favorably modulates gut microbiome, but there are distinct age-specific differences. Studies with human hosts are needed to better understand BC's regulatory effects on the gut microbiome.","2020-02","2022-06-27 16:28:42","2022-06-30 19:30:44","","","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-diet; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multivariate analysis and in silico metagenomics were applied cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The microbial community differed significantly between ITBL and AS in terms of alpha and beta diversity. Both, antibiotic treatment and stenting were associated independently with differences in the microbial community structure. In contrast to AS, in ITBL stenting was associated with pronounced differences in the biliary microbiome, whereas no differences associated with antibiotic treatment could be observed in ITBL contrasting the pronounced differences found in AS. Bacterial pathways involved in the production of antibacterial metabolites were increased in ITBL with antibiotic treatment. After liver transplantation, the biliary tract harbours a complex microbial community with significant differences between ITBL and AS. Fundamental changes in the microbial community in ITBL can be achieved with biliary stenting. However, the effect of antibiotic treatment in ITBL was minimal.

There has been, however, little effort to characterize the microbial diversity including the microbiome dynamics among regions in the Caribbean Sea. Toward this end, this study was designed to gain some critical insights into microbial diversity within the coastal marine ecosystem off the coast of Puerto Rico. Using Illumina MiSeq, the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced with the goal of characterizing the microbial diversity representative of different coastal sites around the island of Puerto Rico. This study provided valuable insights in terms of the local bacterial taxonomic abundance, alpha and beta diversity, and the environmental factors shaping microbial community composition and structure. The most dominant phyla across all 11 sampling sites were the Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes, while the least dominant taxonomic groups were the NKB19, Tenericutes, OP3, Lentisphaerae, and SAR406. The geographical area (Caribbean and Atlantic seas) and salinity gradients were the main drivers shaping the marine microbial community around the island. Despite stable physical and chemical features of the different sites, a highly dynamic microbiome was observed. This highlights Caribbean waters as one of the richest marine sources for a microbial biodiversity hotspot. The data presented here provide a basis for further temporal evaluations aiming at deciphering microbial taxonomic diversity around the island, while determining how microbes adapt to changes in the climate.","2020","2022-06-27 16:28:42","2022-06-29 17:17:36","","45-55","","2","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the dammed Liu River, thermal regimes have been altered, which has resulted in considerable spatial-temporal differences in total dissolved solids (TDSs), oxidation-reduction potential (Eh), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH and in a different microenvironment for bacterioplankton. Among the dominant bacterioplankton phyla, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria account for 38.99%-87.24%, 3.75%-36.55%, 4.77%-38.90%, and 0%-14.44% of the total reads (mean relative frequency), respectively. Bacterioplankton communities are dominated by Brevundimonas, Novosphingobium, Zymomonas, the Actinobacteria hgcIclade, the CL500-29 marine group, Sediminibacterium, Flavobacterium, Pseudarcicella, Cloacibacterium, and Prochlorococcus. Their abundances covary with spatial-temporal variations in hydro-physicochemical factors, as also demonstrated by beta diversity analyses. In addition, temperature plays a pivotal role in maintaining bacterioplankton biodiversity and hydro-physicochemical variations. This result also highlights the concept that ecological niches for aquatic bacteria in dammed karst rivers do not accidentally occur but are the result of a suite of environmental forces.

This potentially negatively impacts the health of Canadians and economic success of our seafood industry. Surveillance studies have shown that up to a significant portion of commercially sold seafood items in Canada are mislabeled or otherwise misrepresented in some way. The current study aimed to determine if the microbiome of fresh shellfish could be used as an accurate marker of harvest location. Total DNA was extracted from the homogenate of 25 batches of fresh soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) harvested in 2015 and 2018 from two locations on the East Coast of Canada and the microbiome of each homogenate was characterized using 16S rRNA targeted amplicon sequencing. Clams harvested from Nova Scotia in both years had a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria (p < 0.05), but a lower abundance of Actinobacteria (p < 0.05) than those from Quebec. Alpha-diversity also differed significantly between sites. Samples harvested from Nova Scotia had greater diversity (p < 0.0001) than those from Quebec. Beta-diversity analysis showed that the microbial community composition was significantly different between the samples from Nova Scotia and Quebec and indicated that 16S rRNA targeted amplicon sequencing might be an effective tool for elucidating the geographic origin of unprocessed shellfish. To evaluate if the microbiome of shellfish experiences a loss of microbial diversity during processing and storage - which would limit the ability of this technique to link retail samples to geographic origin, 10 batches of retail clams purchased from grocery stores were also examined. Microbial diversity and species richness was significantly lower in retail clams, and heavily dominated by Proteobacteria, a typical spoilage organism for fresh seafood, this may make determining the geographic origin of seafood items more difficult in retail clams than in freshly harvested clams.","2020-04-17","2022-06-27 16:28:42","2022-07-19 17:50:29","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-seafood; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Culture-independent microbial diversity analysis suggested bacteria as the dominant group (99.3%) when compared with the archaeal group (0.7%). Alpha diversity analysis showed that microbial richness decreased with the increase of temperature, and beta diversity analysis showed clustering based on location. A total of 131 strains (divided into 12 genera and four phyla) were isolated from the hot spring samples. Incubation temperatures of 37 and 45 degrees C and T5 medium were more suitable for bacterial isolation. Some of the isolated strains shared low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, suggesting that they may be novel bacterial candidates. Some strains produced thermostable enzymes. Dominant microbial communities were found to be different depending on the culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Such differences could be attributed to the fact that most microbes in the studied samples were not cultivable under laboratory conditions. Culture-dependent and culture-independent microbial diversities suggest that these springs not only harbor novel microbial candidates but also produce thermostable enzymes, and hence, appropriate methods should be developed to isolate the uncultivated microbial taxa.","2021-03-03","2022-06-27 16:28:42","2022-07-19 17:10:20","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-water; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amphibian skin microbial community structure has been linked to the clinical outcome of Bd infections, yet its overall functional importance is poorly understood. Methods: Microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles were assessed using high-throughput bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 gene sequencing, bacterial shotgun metagenomics and skin mucosal metabolomics. We sampled 56 wild midwife toads (Alytes obstetricans) from montane populations exhibiting 8d epizootic or enzootic disease dynamics. In addition, to assess whether disease-specific microbiome profiles were linked to microbe-mediated protection or Bd-induced perturbation, we performed a laboratory 8d challenge experiment whereby 40 young adult A. obstetricans were exposed to 8d or a control sham infection. We measured temporal changes in the microbiome as well as functional profiles of Bd-exposed and control animals at peak infection. Results: Microbiome community structure and function differed in wild populations based on infection history and in experimental control versus Bd-exposed animals. 8d exposure in the laboratory resulted in dynamic changes in microbiome community structure and functional differences, with infection clearance in all but one infected animal. Sphingobacterium, Stenotrophomonas and an unclassified Commamonadaceae were associated with wild epizootic dynamics and also had reduced abundance in laboratory Bd-exposed animals that cleared infection, indicating a negative association with 8d resistance. This was further supported by microbe-metabolite integration which identified functionally relevant taxa driving disease outcome, of which Sphingobacterium and 8d were most influential in wild epizootic dynamics. The strong correlation between microbial taxonomic community composition and skin metabolome in the laboratory and field is inconsistent with microbial functional redundancy, indicating that differences in microbial taxonomy drive functional variation. Shotgun metagenomic analyses support these findings, with similar disease-associated patterns in beta diversity. Analysis of differentially abundant bacterial genes and pathways indicated that bacterial environmental sensing and 8d resource competition are likely to be important in driving infection outcomes. Conclusions: 8d infection drives altered microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles across laboratory and field environments. Our application of multi-omics analyses in experimental and field settings robustly predicts 8d disease dynamics and identifies novel candidate biomarkers of infection.","2022-03-10","2022-06-27 16:28:42","2022-06-30 19:19:17","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-amphibian skin; shotgun sequencing; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, characterising temporal variability of the microbiome from large longitudinal COPD cohorts is needed to better understand this phenomenon. Methods We performed a 16S ribosomal RNA survey of microbiome on 716 sputum samples collected longitudinally at baseline and exacerbations from 281 subjects with COPD at three UK clinical centres as part of the COPDMAP consortium. Results The microbiome composition was similar among centres and between stable and exacerbations except for a small significant decrease of Veillonella at exacerbations. The abundance of Moraxella was negatively associated with bacterial alpha diversity. Microbiomes were distinct between exacerbations associated with bacteria versus eosinophilic airway inflammation. Dysbiosis at exacerbations, measured as significant within subject deviation of microbial composition relative to baseline, was present in 41% of exacerbations. Dysbiosis was associated with increased exacerbation severity indicated by a greater fall in forced expiratory volume in one second, forced vital capacity and a greater increase in CAT score, particularly in exacerbations with concurrent eosinophilic inflammation. There was a significant difference of temporal variability of microbial alpha and beta diversity among centres. The variation of beta diversity significantly decreased in those subjects with frequent historical exacerbations. Conclusions Microbial dysbiosis is a feature of some exacerbations and its presence, especially in concert with eosinophilic inflammation, is associated with more severe exacerbations indicated by a greater fall in lung function.","2018-04","2022-06-27 16:28:42","2022-06-30 17:03:52","","331-338","","4","73","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies on salinity effects on soil microbial communities are relatively few while the effects of irrigation-induced salinity on soil chemical and physical properties and plant growth are well documented. In this study, we examined the effects of salinity, temperature, and temporal variability on soil and rhizosphere microbial communities in sand tanks irrigated with prepared solutions designed to simulate saline wastewater. Three sets of experiments with spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Racoon) were conducted under saline water during different time periods (early winter, late spring, and early summer). Bacterial 16S V4 rDNA region was amplified utilizing fusion primers designed against the surrounding conserved regions using MiSeq (R) Illumina sequencing platform. Across the two sample types, bacteria were relatively dominant among three phyla-the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes-accounted for 77.1% of taxa detected in the rhizosphere, while Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria accounted for 55.1% of taxa detected in soil. The results were analyzed using UniFrac coupled with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to compare diversity, abundance, community structure, and specific bacterial groups in soil and rhizosphere samples. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis showed that soil temperature (P = 0.001), rhizosphere temperature (P = 0.001), rhizosphere salinity (P = 0.032), and evapotranspiration (P = 0.002) significantly affected beta diversity of soil and rhizosphere microbial communities. Furthermore, salinity had marginal effects (P = 0.078) on soil beta diversity. However, temporal variability differentially affected rhizosphere microbial communities irrigated with saline wastewater. Therefore, microbial communities in soils impacted by saline irrigation water respond differently to irrigation water quality and season of application due to temporal effects associated with temperature.

As the burden of antibiotic resistance increases, the need for new adjunct therapies designed to facilitate H. pylori eradication and reduce negative distal outcomes associated with infection has become more pressing. Characterization of the interactions between H. pylori, the fecal microbiome, and fecal fatty acid metabolism, as well as the mechanisms underlying these interactions, may offer new therapeutic approaches. AIM To characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome in H. pylori patients in a socioeconomically challenged and underprivileged inner-city community. METHODS Stool samples from 19 H. pylori patients and 16 control subjects were analyzed. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on normalized pooled amplicons using the Illumina MiSeq System using a MiSeq reagent kit v2. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed in QIIME 2. Non-targeted fatty acid analysis of the samples was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which measures the total content of 30 fatty acids in stool after conversion into their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) was performed on Bray-Curtis distance matrices created from both the metabolomics and microbiome datasets and a Procrustes test was performed on the metabolomics and microbiome MDS coordinates. RESULTS Fecal microbiome analysis showed that alpha diversity was lowest in H. pylori patients over 40 years of age compared to control subjects of similar age group. Beta diversity analysis of the samples revealed significant differences in microbial community structure between H. pylori patients and control subjects across all ages. Thirty-eight and six taxa had lower and higher relative abundance in H. pylori patients, respectively. Taxa that were enriched in H. pylori patients included Atopobium, Gemellaceae, Micrococcaceae, Gemellales and Rothia (R. mucilaginosa). Notably, relative abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia was decreased in H. pylori patients compared to control subjects. Procrustes analysis showed a significant relationship between the microbiome and metabolome datasets. Stool samples from H. pylori patients showed increases in several fatty acids including the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 22:4n6, 22:5n3, 20:3n6 and 22:2n6, while decreases were noted in other fatty acids including the PUFA 18:3n6. The pattern of changes in fatty acid concentration correlated to the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio determined by 16S rRNA gene analysis. CONCLUSION This exploratory study demonstrates H. pylori-associated changes to the fecal microbiome and fecal fatty acid metabolism. Such changes may have implications for improving eradication rates and minimizing associated negative distal outcomes.","2021-09-07","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-07-19 14:48:02","","5575-5594","","33","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-antibiotics; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the geographical distance and difference in the physicochemical properties, the microbial compositions of the Segno and Crossfield produced waters exhibited unexpectedly high similarity, as indicated by the results of beta diversity analyses. The major operational taxonomic units included acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanosaetaceae, Methanobacterium and Methanoculleus), as well as bacteria belonging to the families Clostridiaceae and Thermotogaceae, which have been recognized to include thermophilic, thermotolerant, and/or spore-forming subtaxa. The sequence data retrieved from the databases exhibited different clustering patterns, as the communities from close geographical locations invariably had low beta diversity and the physicochemical properties and conditions of the reservoirs apparently did not have a substantial role in shaping of microbial communities.","2018-07","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-06-30 17:02:43","","788-796","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbes in koala intestines are known to break down otherwise toxic compounds, such as tannins, in eucalyptus leaves. Infections by Chlamydia, obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens, are highly prevalent in koala populations. If animals with Chlamydia infections are received by wildlife hospitals, a range of antibiotics can be used to treat them. However, previous studies suggested that koalas can suffer adverse side effects during antibiotic treatment. This study aimed to use 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from koala feces to characterize the intestinal microbiome of koalas throughout antibiotic treatment and identify specific taxa associated with koala health after treatment. Although differences in the alpha diversity were observed in the intestinal flora between treated and untreated koalas and between koalas treated with different antibiotics, these differences were not statistically significant. The alpha diversity of microbial communities from koalas that lived through antibiotic treatment versus those who did not was significantly greater, however. Beta diversity analysis largely confirmed the latter observation, revealing that the overall communities were different between koalas on antibiotics that died versus those that survived or never received antibiotics. Using both machine learning and OTU (operational taxonomic unit) co-occurrence network analyses, we found that OTUs that fare very closely related to Lonepinella koalarum, a known tannin degrader found by culture-based methods to be present in koala intestines, was correlated with a koala's health status. This is the first study to characterize the time course of effects of antibiotics on koala intestinal microbiomes. Our results suggest it may be useful to pursue alternative treatments for Chlamydia infections without the use of antibiotics or the development of Chlamydia-specific antimicrobial compounds that do not broadly affect microbial communities.","2018-03-12","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-07-19 17:27:14","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-marsupial gut; var-antibiotics; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jesse","The Inuit gut microbiome is dynamic over time and shaped by traditional foods","MICROBIOME","","","10.1186/s40168-017-0370-7","","Background: The human gut microbiome represents a diverse microbial community that varies across individuals and populations, and is influenced by factors such as host genetics and lifestyle. Diet is a major force shaping the gut microbiome, and the effects of dietary choices on microbiome composition are well documented. However, it remains poorly known how natural temporal variation in diet can affect the microbiome. The traditional Inuit diet is primarily based on animal products, which are thought to vary seasonally according to prey availability. We previously investigated the Inuit gut microbiome sampled at a single time point, and found no detectable differences in overall microbiome community composition attributable to the traditional Inuit diet. Results: To determine whether seasonal changes in the Inuit diet might induce more pronounced changes in the microbiome, we collected stool and toilet paper samples, and dietary information from Inuit volunteers living in Resolute Bay (Nunavut, Canada), and compared them to individuals of European descent living in Montreal (Quebec, Canada) consuming a typical Western diet. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize microbiome diversity and composition, and compared samples collected with toilet paper or from stool. Our results show that these sampling methods provide similar, but non-identical portraits of the microbiome. Based on toilet paper samples, we found that much of the variation in microbiome community composition could be explained by individual identity (45-61% of variation explained, depending on the beta diversity metric used), with small but significant variation (3-5%) explained by sex or geography (Nunavut or Montreal). In contrast with our previous study at one time point, sampling over the course of a year revealed that diet explains 11% of variation in community composition across all participants, and 17% of variation specifically among Nunavut participants. However, we observed no clear seasonal shifts in the microbiomes of participants from either Nunavut or Montreal. Within-individual microbial diversity fluctuated more over time in Nunavut than in Montreal, consistent with a more variable and highly individualized diet in Nunavut. Conclusions: Together, these results shows that the traditional Inuit diet and lifestyle has an impact on the composition, diversity and stability of the Inuit gut microbiome, even if the seasonality of the diet is less pronounced than expected, perhaps due to an increasingly westernized diet.","2017-11-16","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-07-19 14:49:34","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-diet; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbes in the distal gut contribute to host health through the biosynthesis of vitamins and essential amino acids and the generation of important metabolic by-products from dietary components that are left undigested by the small intestine. Aged citrus peel (Chenpi) is used in traditional Chinese medicine to lower cholesterol, promote weight loss and treat various gastrointestinal symptoms. This study investigated how the microbial community changes during treatment with Chenpi using the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME). Two preparations of Chenpi extract were tested: Chenpi suspended in oil only and Chenpi in a viscoelastic emulsion. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured during treatment to monitor changes in the microbial community of the colon presenting a decrease in production for acetic, propionic and butyric acid (ANOVA (P < 0.001) during the 15 days of treatment. 16S rRNA sequencing of microbial samples showed a clear difference between the two treatments at the different sampling times (ANOSIM P < 0.003; ADOSIM P < 0.002 [R-2 = 69%]). Beta diversity analysis by PcoA showed differences between the two Chenpi formulations for treatment day 6. These differences were no longer detectable as soon as the Chenpi treatment was stopped, showing a reversible effect of Chenpi on the human microbiome. 16S rRNA sequencing of microbial samples from the descending colon showed an increase in Firmicutes for the treatment with the viscoelastic emulsion. At the genus level, Roseburia, Blautia, Subdoligranulum and Eubacterium increased in numbers during the viscoelastic emulsion treatment. This study sheds light on the anti-obesity effect of a polymethoxyflavone (PMFs)-enriched Chenpi extract and creates a foundation for the identification of `obesity-prevention' biomarkers in the gut microbiota.","2022-03","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-06-30 16:58:10","","874-885","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite an immense amount of data generated, systematic, cross-environment analyses of microbiome responses to multiple disturbances are lacking. Here, we present the Microbiome Stress Project, an open-access database of environmental and host-associated 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies collected to facilitate cross-study analyses of microbiome responses to stressors. This database will comprise published and unpublished datasets re-processed from the raw sequences into exact sequence variants using our standardized computational pipeline. Our database will provide insight into general response patterns of microbiome diversity, structure, and stability to environmental stressors. It will also enable the identification of cross-study associations between single or multiple stressors and specific microbial clades. Here, we present a proof-of-concept meta-analysis of 606 microbiomes (from nine studies) to assess microbial community responses to: (1) one stressor in one environment: soil warming across a variety of soil types, (2) a range of stressors in one environment: soil microbiome responses to a comprehensive set of stressors (incl. temperature, diesel, antibiotics, land use change, drought, and heavy metals), (3) one stressor across a range of environments: copper exposure effects on soil, sediment, activated-sludge reactors, and gut environments, and (4) the general trends of microbiome stressor responses. Overall, we found that stressor exposure significantly decreases microbiome alpha diversity and increases beta diversity (community dispersion) across a range of environments and stressor types. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between microbial community resistance to stressors (i.e., the average pairwise similarity score between the control and stressed communities) and alpha diversity. We used Phylofactor to identify microbial clades and individual taxa as potential bioindicators of copper contamination across different environments. Using standardized computational and statistical methods, the Microbiome Stress Project will leverage thousands of existing datasets to build a general framework for how microbial communities respond to environmental stress.","2019-01-10","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-07-19 19:22:12","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-soil; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Local or systemic inflammation after trauma/hemorrhage may lead to a leaky intestinal epithelial barrier and subsequent translocation of gut microbiota, potentially worsening outcomes. To evaluate the extent with which trauma affects the gut microbiota composition, we performed a post hoc analysis of a murine model of polytrauma and hemorrhage. Four hours after injury, organs and plasma samples were collected, and the diversity and composition of the cecal microbiome were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Although cecal microbial alpha diversity and microbial community composition were not found to be different between experimental groups, norepinephrine support in shock animals resulted in increased alpha diversity, as indicated by higher numbers of distinct microbial features. We observed that the concentrations of proinflammatory mediators in plasma and intestinal tissue were associated with measures of microbial alpha and beta diversity and the presence of specific microbial drivers of inflammation, suggesting that the composition of the gut microbiome at the time of trauma, or shortly after trauma exposure, may play an important role in determining physiological outcomes. In conclusion, we found associations between measures of gut microbial alpha and beta diversity and the severity of systemic and local gut inflammation. Furthermore, our data suggest that four hours following injury is too early for development of global changes in the alpha diversity or community composition of the intestinal microbiome. Future investigations with increased temporal-spatial resolution are needed in order to fully elucidate the effects of trauma and shock on the gut microbiome, biological signatures of inflammation, and proximal and distal outcomes.","2021-03-23","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-06-30 17:01:25","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study describes the built environment microbiome of lactation rooms and daycares, and explores the influence of temperature and humidity on the microbiome of lactation rooms. Sterile swabs were used to collect samples from five different sites in lactation rooms at University of California, Davis and from five different sites in daycares located in Davis, California. DNA from the swabs was extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Temperature and relative humidity data were collected on a subset of the lactation rooms. Sampled lactation rooms could be either dedicated lactation rooms or could also serve other functions (e.g., combined lactation room and restroom lounge). The majority of sequence reads were identified as belonging to family Moraxellaceae, with 73% of all reads included in analysis identified as an unknown species of Acinetobacter. Alpha diversity was analyzed using the Shannon index, while beta diversity was analyzed using unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance. The Jaccard distance was used to measure amount of change at sampling locations between time points for analysis of the impact of temperature and humidity on the microbiome. There were significant differences in the beta diversity of the microbiome of lactation rooms by room type. There were also significant differences in the beta diversity of the microbiome by sample collection location. There were no significant differences in either alpha or beta diversity associated with room temperature or humidity.

An understanding of the animal's resident respiratory pathogens, in the upper nasal cavity prior to weaning, may help us to understand the impact of these pathogens on incidence of respiratory disease. For this research, the overall goal was to characterize bacterial populations associated with calves at an early age and through time periods prior to weaning in 3 herds at the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center. Nasal swabs from the upper nasal cavity were collected at initial vaccination (approximately 40 d of age), preconditioning (approximately 130 d of age), and weaning (approximately 150 d of age) in 2015 and 2016. DNA was extracted from nasal swabs and combined into 2 pools of 10 animals for each sampling time point, in each herd, for a total of 6 pools at each sampling time point and 18 pools for all sampling time points within each year. To evaluate and compare the microbiome of each pooled sample, hypervariable regions 1 through 3 along the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced using next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) for identification of the bacterial taxa present. Alpha and beta diversity were also measured. Overall, microbial communities were different between combinations of sampling year, herd location, and sampling time prior to weaning as shown by beta diversity. Analysis of these specific respiratory pathogens prior to weaning will present a clearer picture of the distribution of microbial populations in animals prior to weaning and not exhibiting clinical signs of respiratory disease. Therefore, evaluation of the animal's resident bacterial populations in the upper nasal cavity during different phases of the beef production system may help us to understand the impact of the microbiome on incidence of respiratory disease in cattle.","2019-06","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-06-30 19:54:29","","2368-2375","","6","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle nasal; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, termites were fed six dietary sources and the microbial community was monitored over a 49-day period using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A deep backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) was used to learn how the six different lignocellulose food sources affected the temporal composition of the hindgut microbiota of the termite as well as taxon-taxon and taxon-substrate interactions. Results: Shifts in the termite gut microbiota after diet change in each colony were observed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and beta diversity analyses. The artificial neural network accurately predicted the relative abundances of taxa at random points in the temporal study and showed that low-abundant taxa maintain community driving correlations in the hindgut.

Sediment pH and salinity showed significant effects on the diversity and keystone taxa of bacterial and archaeal communities. The bacterial and archaeal co-occurrence networks were inextricably linked with pH and salinity to formed the large network nodes, suggesting that they were the key factors to drive the prokaryotic community. We also identified that heterogeneous and homogeneous selection drove the bacterial and archaeal community assembly, while the two selections became weaker from offshore sites to inshore sites, suggesting that deterministic processes were more important in offshore sites.

Participants who maintained a healthy or unhealthy diet (i.e., stayed in the highest or lowest quintile of a healthy diet score throughout follow-up) were selected.

Our results highlight the potential of FCM-based microbiome profiling as a reliable and accessible diagnostic tool that can provide novel insights into cancer therapy-associated dysbiosis dynamics.","2022-12-31","2022-06-27 16:28:43","2022-07-18 22:06:28","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to macroorganisms, the beta-diversity of soil microbes and its drivers are less studied. Whether the determinants of soil microbial beta-diversity are consistent between soil depths and between abundant and rare microorganisms remains controversial. Here, using the 16S-rRNA of soil bacteria and archaea sampled at different soil depths (0-10 and 30-50 cm) from 32 sites along an aridity gradient of 1500 km in the temperate grasslands in northern China, we compared the effects of deterministic and stochastic processes on the taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity of soil microbes. Using variation partitioning and null models, we found that the taxonomic beta-diversity of the overall bacterial communities was more strongly determined by deterministic processes in both soil layers (the explanatory power of environmental distance in topsoil: 25.4%; subsoil: 47.4%), while their phylogenetic counterpart was more strongly determined by stochastic processes (the explanatory power of spatial distance in topsoil: 42.1; subsoil 24.7%). However, in terms of abundance, both the taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity of the abundant bacteria in both soil layers was more strongly determined by deterministic processes, while those of rare bacteria were more strongly determined by stochastic processes. In comparison with bacteria, both the taxonomic and phylogenetic beta-diversity of the overall abundant and rare archaea were strongly determined by deterministic processes. Among the variables representing deterministic processes, contemporary and historical climate and aboveground vegetation dominated the microbial beta-diversity of the overall and abundant microbes of both domains in topsoils, but soil geochemistry dominated in subsoils. This study presents a comprehensive understanding on the beta-diversity of soil microbial communities in the temperate grasslands in northern China. Our findings highlight the importance of soil depth, phylogenetic turnover, and species abundance in the assembly processes of soil microbial communities.","2021-09","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-07-19 19:28:03","","","","9","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-environmental; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Confounding factors such as diet and healthcare make it difficult to disentangle the interactions between age, health, and microbial changes in humans. Animal models present an excellent opportunity to study age- and sex-linked variation in the microbiome, but captivity is known to influence animal microbial abundance and composition, while studies of free-ranging animals are typically limited to studies of the fecal microbiome using samples collected non-invasively. Here, we analyze a large dataset of oral, rectal, and genital swabs collected from 105 free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, aged 1 month-26 years), comprising one entire social group, from the island of Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. We sequenced 16S V4 rRNA amplicons for all samples.ResultsInfant gut microbial communities had significantly higher relative abundances of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and lower abundances of Ruminococcus, Fibrobacter, and Treponema compared to older age groups, consistent with a diet high in milk rather than solid foods. The genital microbiome varied widely between males and females in beta-diversity, taxonomic composition, and predicted functional profiles. Interestingly, only penile, but not vaginal, microbiomes exhibited distinct age-related changes in microbial beta-diversity, taxonomic composition, and predicted functions. Oral microbiome composition was associated with age, and was most distinctive between infants and other age classes.ConclusionsAcross all three body regions, with notable exceptions in the penile microbiome, while infants were distinctly different from other age groups, microbiomes of adults were relatively invariant, even in advanced age. While vaginal microbiomes were exceptionally stable, penile microbiomes were quite variable, especially at the onset of reproductive age. Relative invariance among adults, including elderly individuals, is contrary to findings in humans and mice. We discuss potential explanations for this observation, including that age-related microbiome variation seen in humans may be related to changes in diet and lifestyle.","2021-03-22","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-07-18 22:20:13","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-primate genitals; biome-primate oral; var-age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpha diversity (within community) was nonsignificant for all groups; however, beta diversity analysis among communities showed that 5% BHH suppressed the significant changes induced by the high-fat diet. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, the family S24-7 within the order Bacteroidales, the family Lachnospiraceae and several cellulolytic taxa were slightly ameliorated in the BHH group. These results indicated that BHH supplementation influenced the gut bacterial community and suppressed the high-fat diet-induced alterations. Additionally, BHH significantly lowered the serum cholesterol levels and fecal pH. Improving short-chain fatty acid production for all of the bacterial communities in the mouse guts may induce this effect. Thus, the prebiotic potential of BHH should be evaluated considering the gut microbial communities and their interactions.","2021-05","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-06-30 19:18:42","","","","5","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-diet; var-pH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, for non-human primates (NHPs), little is known about their gut microbial community in high-altitude environments and even less about their adaption to such habitats. We characterised the gut microbial community of rhesus macaques from multiple high-altitude environments and compared it to those of low-altitude populations. Results We collected faecal samples of rhesus macaques from four high-altitude populations (above 3000 m) and three low-altitude populations (below 500 m). By calculating the alpha diversity index, we found that high-altitude populations exhibited a higher diversity. Statistical analysis of beta diversity indicated significant differences between high- and low-altitude populations. Significant differences were also detected at the phylum and family levels. At the phylum level, the high-altitude gut microbial community was dominated by Firmicutes (63.42%), while at low altitudes, it was dominated by Bacteroidetes (47.4%). At the family level, the high-altitude population was dominated by Ruminococcaceae (36.2%), while the low-altitude one was dominated by Prevotellaceae (39.6%). Some families, such as Christensenellaceae and Rikenellaceae, were consistently higher abundant in all high-altitude populations. We analysed the overlap of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in high-altitude populations and determined their core OTUs (shared by all four high-altitude populations). However, when compared with the low-altitude core OTUs, only 65% were shared, suggesting a divergence in core OTUs. Function prediction indicated a significant difference in gene copy number of 35 level-2 pathways between high- and low-altitude populations; 29 of them were higher in high altitudes, especially in membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism. Conclusions The gut microbial community of high-altitude rhesus macaques was significantly distinct from that of low-altitude populations in terms of diversity, composition and function. High-altitude populations were dominated by Firmicutes and Ruminococcace, while in low-altitude populations, Bacteroidetes and Prevotellaceae were dominant. The difference in gut microbiota between these two populations may be caused by differences in host diet, environmental temperature and oxygen pressure. These differentiated gut microbial microorganisms may play a critical role in the adaptive evolution of rhesus macaques to high-altitude environments.","2020-03-26","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-07-19 14:40:52","","","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-primate gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This requires an understanding of the effects of different treatments on the fish microbiota as a measure for improving the fish health status. In this study, we focused on the freshwater pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum and investigated the effects of antibiotics (florfenicol) and phage therapies on the gut microbiota of healthy and infected rainbow trout fry (1-2 g). Florfenicol-coated feed was administered for 10 days, starting two days after the infection procedure. A two-component mix of phage targeting F. psychrophilum (FpV4 and FPSV-D22) was continuously delivered by feed with a prophylactic period of 12 days. Samples of the distal intestine were collected over time (day -1 and 1, 8, and 33 days post-infection) and analyzed by community analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region). Results showed the dysbiosis effect caused both by the infection and by florfenicol administration. Shifts in the overall composition were detected by beta-diversity analysis, and changes in specific populations were observed during taxonomic mapping. Measures of alpha-diversity were only affected in infected fish (large variation observed 1 and 8 dpi). These community alterations disappeared again when fish recovered from the infection and the antibiotic treatment was terminated (33 dpi). Interestingly, phage addition altered the microbiota of the fish independently of the presence of their target bacterium. The overall gut bacterial community in fish fed phage-treated feed was different from the controls at each time point as revealed by beta-diversity analysis. However, it was not possible to identify specific bacterial populations responsible for these changes except for an increase of lactic acid bacteria 33 dpi. Overall, the results indicate that the administered phages might affect the complex network of phage-bacteria interactions in the fish gut. Nevertheless, we did not observe negative effects on fish health or growth, and further studies should be directed in understanding if these changes are beneficial or not for the fish health with an additional focus on the host immune response.","2022-05-10","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-07-19 15:09:41","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fish gut; var-antibiotics; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted the first microbiome analysis of an Indigenous population using modern molecular techniques. We investigated the caries-associated microbiome among Canadian First Nations children with S-ECC. Thirty First Nations children <72 mo of age with S-ECC and 20 caries-free children were recruited in Winnipeg, Canada. Parents or caregivers completed a questionnaire on general and dental health, diet, and demographics. The plaque microbiome was investigated by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units and taxonomy assigned via the Human Oral Microbiome Database, then analyzed at the community level with alpha and beta diversity measures. Compared with those who were caries free, children with S-ECC came from households with lower income; they were more likely to live in First Nations communities and were more likely to be bottle-fed; and they were weaned from the bottle at a later age. The microbial communities of the S-ECC and caries-free groups did not differ in terms of species richness or phylogenetic diversity. Beta diversity analysis showed that the samples significantly clustered into groups based on caries status. Twenty-eight species-level operational taxonomic units were significantly different between the groups, including Veillonella HOT 780 and Porphyromonas HOT 284, which were 4.6- and 9-fold higher, respectively, in the S-ECC group, and Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus sanguinis, which were 5- and 2-fold higher, respectively, in the caries-free group. Extremely high levels of Streptococcus mutans were detected in the S-ECC group. Overall, First Nations children with S-ECC have a significantly different plaque microbiome than their caries-free counterparts, with the S-ECC group containing higher levels of known cariogenic organisms.","2017-11","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-07-19 15:23:23","","1378-1385","","12","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-socioeconomic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We assessed bacterial and fungal communities by sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS data. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity was decomposed into two components: species replacement (species turnover) and nestedness to further explore the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity patterns and its causes. The results show that both bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were derived almost entirely from species turnover rather than from species nestedness. Distance-decay relationships confirmed that the geographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity were significantly different. Environmental factors had the dominant influence on both the bacterial and fungal beta-diversity and species turnover, however, the role of geographic distance varied across bacterial and fungal communities. Furthermore, both bacterial and fungal nestedness did not significantly respond to the environmental and geographic distance. Our findings suggest that the different response of bacterial and fungal species turnover to dispersal limitation and other, unknown processes may result in different biogeographic patterns of bacterial and fungal beta-diversity in the drylands of northwest China.

Understanding the ecological processes shaping microbial communities is of crucial importance for aquatic microbial ecology and biogeography. However, the diversity of microorganisms and the forces that control this diversity are poorly understood. This is particularly true within the framework of the river-lake continuum in arid regions. Results Using a whole catchment-sampling effort, we explored biogeographical patterns and mechanisms of microbial community (bacteria and archaea) assembly within the catchment of the largest inland once freshwater lake (Lake Bosten) in China. Water samples from headstream tributaries, the mainstream of the River Kaidu to downstream Lake Bosten were characterized using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Higher alpha-diversity was found in mainstream of River Kaidu and in the tributaries compared with Lake Bosten. And the microbial community composition was also significantly different between the lake and its connected river habitats. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that salinity and total suspended solids were the most important environmental factors shaping the community variations. Overall, pure environmental and pure spatial factors explained 13.7 and 5.6% of the community variation, respectively, while 32.0% of the variation was explained by combined environmental and spatial variables. These observations suggested that spatially structured environmental variations mainly shaped the microbial biogeography in this region. Both deterministic and stochastic processes influenced the microbial community assembly in river and lake habitats, and the stochastic pattern was particularly pronounced for microbiome in river habitat. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed more abundant and complicated correlations among frequently occurred taxa in lake habitat compared with the river habitat, implying that ecological multispecies interactions (e.g., competition) shaped lake microbial community structures. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate an ecological succession along the river-lake continuum of microbial communities across the largest inland once freshwater lake basin in China, and highlight the effects of spatially structured environmental factors on regional microbial beta-diversity and species interactions on local community assembly.","2020-04-25","2022-06-27 16:28:44","2022-07-19 17:42:22","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the distribution pattern of alpine soil bacterial communities and related deterministic factors still remain to be explored. In this study, soils were collected from different altitudes and slope aspects of the Mount (Mt.) Shergyla, Tibetan Plateau, and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene-based bioinformatics approaches. Acidobacteriota and Proteobacteria were identified consistently as the two predominant phyla in all soil samples, accounting for approximately 74% of the bacterial community. The alpha diversity of the soil bacterial community generally increased as the vegetation changed with the elevated altitude, but no significant differences in alpha diversity were observed between the two slopes. Beta diversity analysis of bacterial community showed that soil samples from the north slope were always differentiated obviously from the paired samples at the south slope with the same altitude. The whole network constituted by soil bacterial genera at the Mt. Shergyla was parsed into eight modules, and Elev-16S-573, Sericytochromatia, KD4-96, TK10, Pedomicrobium, and IMCC26256 genera were identified as the “hubs” in the largest module. The distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) demonstrated that variations in soil bacterial community thereof with the altitude and slope aspects at the Mt.

Urbanized estuaries are vulnerable intersections between terrestrial and marine ecosystems and are susceptible to pressure and perturbation from both natural processes and human activities over time. The response by microbial communities toward changes in the environment should be closely monitored and studied. In this study, microbial communities in brackish intertidal sediments, sampled seasonally over a year along the coast of Yangtze River estuary, were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Potential compositional and functional changes in microbial communities resulting from temporal variation and associated physiochemical gradients in the environment were studied and notable patterns were observed over time. Summer season was recorded with the lowest microbial community alpha-diversity. For beta-diversity, spatiotemporal differentiation in community structures was recorded with seasonal clustering. Proteobacteria was recorded as the most dominant phylum among all sampling sites throughout the year but its relative abundance showed no temporal changes. Instead, relative abundances of phyla Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobia were found to differ significantly over time, generally favoring the wet Spring and Summer. In contrast, temporal variation was observed for the class Deltaproteobacteria and some of the corresponding sulfate/sulfur-reducing bacterial genera, favoring the dry Autumn and Winter. However, there were no major temporal changes in ecological functions contributed by microbial communities throughout the study period. While results from redundancy analysis showed that the subtle changes in pH in the environment had the greatest impact on microbial community composition, the variation it explained remained relatively low. Alternatively, precipitation, distinguishing the dry and wet seasons of the subtropical monsoon climate zone, was suggested to be another potential key factor influencing microbial community composition and their relative abundances.

To characterize spatiotemporal trends of microbial assemblages in precipitation we sequenced 16S (bacterial) and 18S (fungal) rRNA gene amplicon libraries collected from 72 precipitation events in three U.S. states (Idaho, Louisiana, and Virginia) over four seasons. We considered these data from the perspective of a novel metacommunity framework. In agreement with our heuristic, we found evidence for distinct mechanisms underlying the composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal assemblages in precipitation. Specifically, we determined that (1) bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) composition of precipitation was strongly associated with macroscale drivers including season and high-altitude characteristics of storms; (2) fungal OTU composition was strongly correlated with mesoscale drivers including particular spatial locations; (3) beta-diversity (heterogeneity of taxa among samples) for both bacteria and fungi was largely maintained by turnover of taxa; however, (4) bacterial assemblages had higher contributions to total beta-diversity from nestedness (i.e., lower richness assemblages were largely taxonomic subsets of richer assemblages), due to losses of taxa during dispersal, particularly among potential ice nucleation active bacteria; and (5) fungal assemblages had higher contributions to total beta-diversity from turnover due to OTU replacement. Spatiotemporal trends in precipitation-borne metacommunities allowed delineation of a large number of statistically significant indicator taxa for particular sites and seasons, including trends for bacteria that are potentially ice nucleation active. Our findings advance understanding regarding the dispersion of aerosolized microbes via wet deposition, and the development of theory concerning potential assembly rules for bioaerosol assemblages.","2020-02","2022-06-27 16:28:45","2022-06-30 17:07:53","","","","1","90","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Presently, the drivers of microbial community structure remain unexplored in maize cropping systems under complex and variable environmental scenarios across large spatial scales. In this study, we conducted high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and network analysis to identify the major environmental factors driving bacterial community diversity and co-occurrence patterns in 21 maize field soils across China. The results show that mean annual precipitation and soil pH are the major environmental factors that shape soil bacterial communities in maize soils. The similarities of bacterial communities significantly decreased with increasing geographic distance between different sites. The differences in spatial turnover rates across bacterial phyla indicate the distinct dispersal capabilities of bacterial groups, and some abundant phyla exhibited high dispersal capabilities. Aeromicrobium, Friedmanniella, Saccharothrix, Lamia, Rhodococcus, Skermanella, and Pedobacter were identified as keystone taxa. Based on the node-level and network-level topological features, members of the core microbiome were more frequently found in the center of the ecosystem network compared with other taxa. This study highlights the major environmental factors driving bacterial community assembly in agro-ecosystems and the central ecological role of the core microbiome in maintaining the web of complex bacterial interactions.","2020-04-07","2022-06-27 16:28:45","2022-06-30 17:03:45","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Increasing the amount of fruit and restaurant wastes in the feed mixture significantly enhanced the productivity of the systems (16% increase in the mesophilic systems and 41% in the thermophilic). The methane content of biogas was also favored at higher temperatures. Beta diversity analysis, based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene, showed that microbial communities of the thermophilic digestions were more similar to each other than the mesophilic digestions. Species richness of the thermophilic digestions was significantly greater than the corresponding mesophilic digestions (F = 40.08, p = 0.003). The mesophilic digesters were dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes while in thermophilic digesters, the phyla Firmicutes and Chloroflexi accounted for up to 90% of all sequences. Methanosarcina represented the key methanogen and was more abundant in thermophilic digestions.

To get more accurate information on the composition of these indoor microbial communities, both water and air microbiome from a pharmaceutical production plant were profiled by 16S amplicon sequencing. Results: In the water system, we found taxa which typically characterize surface freshwater, groundwater and oligotrophic environments. The airborne microbiome resulted dominated by taxa usually found in outdoor air in combination with human-associated taxa. The alpha-and beta-diversity values showed that the heat-based sanitization process of the water plant affects the composition of the water microbiome by transiently increasing both diversity and evenness. Taxonomic compositional shifts were also detected in response to sanitization, consisting in an increase of Firmicutes and a-Proteobacteria. On the other hand, seasonality seems to be the main driver of bacterial community composition in air of this work environment. Conclusions: This approach resulted useful to describe the taxonomy of these indoor microbiomes and could be further applied to other built environments, in which the knowledge of the microbiome composition is of relevance.

Contrary to popular myth, the nutritional and chemical compositions, water contents, O2 contents, temperatures, and pH in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a human are very different in a location-specific manner, implying heterogeneity of the microbial composition in a location-specific manner. Results We first investigated the environmental conditions at 6 different locations along the GI tract and feces of ten weeks' old male SPF C57BL/6 mice. As previously known, the pH and water contents of the GI contents at the different locations of the GI tract were very different from each other in a location-specific manner, and none of which were not even similar to those of feces. After confirming the heterogeneous nature of the GI contents in specific locations and feces, we thoroughly analyzed the composition of the microbiome of the GI contents and feces. 16S rDNA-based metagenome sequencing on the GI contents and feces showed the presence of 13 different phyla. The abundance of Firmicutes gradually decreased from the stomach to feces while the abundance of Bacteroidetes gradually increased. The taxonomic alpha-diversities measured by ACE (Abundance-based Coverage Estimator) richness, Shannon diversity, and Fisher's alpha all indicated that the diversities of gut microbiome at colon and cecum were much higher than that of feces. The diversities of microbiome compositions were lowest in jejunum and ileum while highest in cecum and colon. Interestingly, the diversities of the fecal microbiome were lower than those of the cecum and colon. Beta diversity analyses by NMDS plots, PCA, and unsupervised hierarchical clustering all showed that the microbiome compositions were very diverse in a location-specific manner. Direct comparison of the fecal microbiome with the microbiome of the whole GI tracts by alpha-and beta-diversities showed that the fecal microbiome did not represent the microbiome of the whole GI tract. Conclusion The fecal microbiome is different from the whole microbiome of the GI tract, contrary to a baseline assumption of contemporary microbiome research work.","2021-02-12","2022-06-27 16:28:45","2022-07-19 14:49:59","","","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-rodent gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In domestic birds, ceca have the greatest gastrointestinal microbial population. Feather-pecking (FP) behavior in laying hens is one of the most important unsolved behavioral issues in modern agriculture. The aim of the present study was to assess the cecal microbial community of divergently selected high (HFP; n = 20) and low (LFP; n = 20) feather-pecking birds at 60 wk of age. The cecal samples were subjected to community profiling of 16S rRNA and in silico metagenomics using a modified bar-coded Illumina sequencing method on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer. Our results revealed that compared to HFP birds, LFP birds are characterized by an increased overall microbial diversity (beta diversity) shown by a difference in the Bray-Curtis index (R-2 = 0.171, P < 0.05). Furthermore, operational taxonomic unit comparisons showed an increased presence of Clostridiae and decreased presence of Lactobaccilla-cae in HFP birds when compared to LFP birds (False Discovery Rate < 0.05, Mann-Whitney comparisons). Our data indicate that there may be differences in the cecal profile between these 2 lines of laying hens. More research, building on this first study using sequencing technology for profiling the chicken cecal microbiome, will be needed in order to reveal if and how there exists a functional link between the performance of FP and the cecal microbial community.","2018-09","2022-06-27 16:28:45","2022-07-19 14:44:09","","3009-3014","","9","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ten maize hybrids (six newer and four older) were grown in a replicated field trial. The endosphere, rhizosphere and soil bacterial and archaeal communities were sampled and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sampling was done at two developmental stages in a water-limited environment with and without supplemental irrigation. Significant shifts in microbial community composition (beta-diversity) were measured between two sampling times during the season, in well-watered and water-stressed conditions and in newer and older generation maize hybrids. The microbial community diversity within samples (alpha-diversity) was not affected by drought stress or host factors. The phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were more abundant in the rhizosphere of newer hybrids under water stress. These results highlight the importance of temporal variation, environmental stress and plant genetics as influenced by breeding history in shaping the composition of root associated microbial communities.

Similar to natural rivers, manmade inlets connect inland runoff to the ocean. Port Everglades Inlet (PEI) is a busy cargo and cruise ship port in South Florida, which can act as a source of pollution to surrounding beaches and offshore coral reefs. Understanding the composition and fluctuations of bacterioplankton communities (”microbiomes”) in major port inlets is important due to potential impacts on surrounding environments. We hypothesize seasonal microbial fluctuations, which were profiled by high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis. Methods & Results. Surface water samples were collected every week for one year. A total of four samples per month, two from each sampling location, were used for statistical analysis creating a high sampling frequency and finer sampling scale than previous inlet microbiome studies. We observed significant differences in community alpha diversity between months and seasons. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) tests were run in QIIME 2 at genus level taxonomic classification to determine which genera were differentially abundant between seasons and months. Beta diversity results yielded significant differences in PEI community composition in regard to month, season, water temperature, and salinity. Analysis of potentially pathogenic genera showed presence of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus. However, statistical analysis indicated that these organisms were not present in significantly high abundances throughout the year or between seasons. Discussion. Significant differences in alpha diversity were observed when comparing microbial communities with respect to time. This observation stems from the high community evenness and low community richness in August. This indicates that only a few organisms dominated the community during this month. August had lower than average rainfall levels for a wet season, which may have contributed to less runoff, and fewer bacterial groups introduced into the port surface waters. Bacterioplankton beta diversity differed significantly by month, season, water temperature, and salinity. The 2013-2014 dry season (October-April), was warmer and wetter than historical averages. This may have driven significant differences in beta diversity. Increased nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations were observed in these dry season months, possibly creating favorable bacterial growth conditions. Potentially pathogenic genera were present in the PEI. However their relatively low, non-significant abundance levels highlight their relatively low risk for public health concerns. This study represents the first to sample a large port at this sampling scale and sequencing depth. These data can help establish the inlet microbial community baseline and supplement the vital monitoring of local marine and recreational environments, all the more poignant in context of local reef disease outbreaks and worldwide coral reef collapse in wake of a harsh 2014-16 El Nino event.","2018-05-08","2022-06-27 16:28:45","2022-06-29 17:09:02","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-longitudinal; var-salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, increasing evidence suggests that oral microbiome profiles differ according to dentition stages, but it is unclear whether they change with age during the same dentition, such as deciduous dentition. These two aspects were investigated in a 2-year follow-up study, and caries-free preschool children with complete deciduous dentition were enrolled. Saliva was collected and oral examination was conducted at the beginning of this trial, and then every subsequent 6 months for a total of five time points (T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4). Based on the clinical examination of teeth at the end of the trial, subjects were divided into health-to-health (H-H, N = 11) and health-to-caries (H-C, N = 12) groups at every time point. A total of 115 saliva samples from 23 subjects was detected by sequencing 16S rDNA V3-V4 hypervariable regions with the Illumina MiSeq platform to obtain microbiome profiles, and 100 samples finally passed quality control for further analyses. A total of 4,328,852 high-quality sequencing reads passed quality-control testing, representing 14 phyla, 27 classes, 43 orders, 67 families, and 127 genera. An alpha diversity analysis showed that salivary microbial diversity was similar in all groups, and a beta diversity analysis showed that salivary microbial community structure changed with dental caries. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis revealed that the abundance of the genera Atopobium, Megasphaera, and Veillonella increased significantly, while that of the genera Shuttleworthia and Rothia decreased significantly with the development of dental caries. Megasphaera and Veillonella were enriched at the early stage of deciduous dentition whereas Peptococcus, Rothia, and Treponema were enriched at the later stage. The core microbiome in the H-H and H-C groups comprised 26 and 29 genera, respectively, with statistical differences observed in 11 shared core genera. These results provide new insights into variations in the salivary microbiome related to dental caries and age in the deciduous dentition period.","2018-04-04","2022-06-27 16:28:46","2022-06-29 17:04:03","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the gut microbiome has been implicated in the development of NAFLD, the strong association of obesity with NAFLD and its effect on microbiome structure has made interpreting study outcomes difficult. In the present study, we examined the taxonomic and functional differences between the microbiomes of youth with obesity and with and without NAFLD. Shotgun metagenome sequencing was performed to profile the microbiomes of 36 subjects, half of whom were diagnosed with NAFLD using abdominal magnetic resonance imaging. Beta diversity analysis showed community-wide differences between the groups (p = 0.002). Specific taxonomic differences included increased relative abundances of the species Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans (p = 0.042), Romboutsia ilealis (p = 0.046), and Actinomyces sp. ICM47 (p = 0.0009), and a decrease of Bacteroides thetaiotamicron (p = 0.0002), in the NAFLD group as compared with the non-NAFLD group. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes (p < 0.0001) was decreased in the NAFLD group. Functionally, branched-chain amino acid (p = 0.01343) and aromatic amino acid (p = 0.01343) synthesis pathways had increased relative abundances in the NAFLD group along with numerous energy use pathways, including pyruvate fermentation to acetate (p = 0.01318). Conclusion: Community-wide differences were noted based on NAFLD status, and individual bacterial species along with specific metabolic pathways were identified as potential drivers of these differences. The results of the present study support the idea that the NAFLD phenotype displays a differentiated microbial and functional signature from the obesity phenotype.","","2022-06-27 16:28:46","2022-06-30 17:45:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article; Early Access","","","","shotgun sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metagenomic DNA was extracted from maize rhizosphere and bulk samples and sequencing was performed using the shotgun metagenomic approach. Comparative analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in the distribution of microbial communities across the soils. Alpha diversity indices (Simpson, Shannon, and Evenness) were higher in the former grassland soils and beta diversity analysis revealed a significant difference (p = 0.01) in microbial community structure between the fields, with the highest dissimilarity (21.03%) observed between the rhizosphere soils. Among all taxonomic levels in the study, a total of 23 taxa were observed to be differentially abundant in the samples. Soil pH, with a contribution of 51% and a p-value of 0.002 was the most influential soil parameter that determined microbial distribution across the soils. Differences were also observed in the abundance of metabolic pathways (alpha = 0.05) across the samples. Overall, differences in the soils' chemical properties were attributed to land-use and management histories, which contributed to the dissimilarities observed in the microbial structural diversity and metabolic pathways.

Participating patients provided a fresh stool sample the week before their study visit, from which microbial DNA was extracted and sequenced for the 16S rRNA region in an Illumina MiSeq2 platform. Microbial and statistical analyses were conducted to determine the alpha-diversity (number of different taxa within a sample) and beta-diversity (number of overlapping taxa between samples). Stool samples from 58 patients were eligible for analysis. There were 27 patients with HCV genotype 1, 10 with genotype 2, 16 with genotype 3, and 5 with genotype 4. No statistically significant differences in gut microbiota diversity, species richness, or microbial community pattern were found at baseline and at post-treatment Week 12. Lack of statistically significant differences remained consistent in further analysis by demographic and baseline disease characteristics. Surprisingly, no statistically significant changes in alpha- and beta-diversity were seen in the microbiota after GLE/PIB treatment, though there was a trend toward less richness over time.

We used WGSS data to investigate ambient temperature stability and putative gold-standard concordance of microbial profiles in fecal samples collected and stored using fecal occult blood test (FOBT) cards, fecal immunochemical test (FIT) tubes, 95% ethanol, or RNAlater. Among 15 Mayo Clinic employees, for each collection method, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) to estimate stability of fecal microbial profiles after storage for 4?days at ambient temperature and concordance with immediately frozen, no-solution samples (i.e., the putative gold standard). ICCs were estimated for multiple metrics, including relative abundances of select phyla, species, KEGG k-genes (representing any coding sequence that had >70% identity and >70% query coverage with respect to a known KEGG ortholog), KEGG modules, and KEGG pathways; species and k-gene alpha diversity; and Bray-Curtis and Jaccard species beta diversity. ICCs for microbial profile stability were excellent (>= 90%) for fecal samples collected via most of the collection methods, except those preserved in 95% ethanol. Concordance with the immediately frozen, no-solution samples varied for all collection methods, but the number of observed species and the beta diversity metrics tended to have higher concordance than other metrics. Our findings, taken together with previous studies and feasibility considerations, indicated that FOBT cards, FIT tubes, and RNAlater are acceptable choices for fecal sample collection methods in future WGSS studies. IMPORTANCE A major direction for future microbiome research is implementation of fecal sample collections in large-scale, prospective epidemiologic studies. Studying microbiome-disease associations likely requires microbial data to be pooled from multiple studies. Our findings suggest collection methods that are most optimal to be used standardly across future WGSS microbiome studies.","2020-02","2022-06-27 16:28:46","2022-07-19 17:49:40","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-sampling methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Frozen for at least two consecutive years, but often for millennia, permafrost temperatures have increased drastically in the last decades. The resulting thermal erosion leads not only to gradual thaw, resulting in an increase of seasonally thawing soil thickness, but also to abrupt thaw events, such as sudden collapses of the soil surface. These could affect 20% of the permafrost zone and half of its organic carbon, increasing accessibility for deeper rooting vegetation and microbial decomposition into greenhouse gases. Knowledge gaps include the impact of permafrost thaw on the soil microfauna as well as key taxa to change the microbial mineralization of ancient permafrost carbon stocks during erosion. Here, we present the first sequencing study of an abrupt permafrost erosion microbiome in Northeast Greenland, where a thermal erosion gully collapsed in the summer of 2018, leading to the thawing of 26,500-year-old permafrost material. We investigated which soil parameters (pH, soil carbon content, age and moisture, organic and mineral horizons, and permafrost layers) most significantly drove changes of taxonomic diversity and the abundance of soil microorganisms in two consecutive years of intense erosion. Sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 gene regions at finely scaled depth increments revealed decreasing alpha diversity with depth, soil age, and pH. The most significant drivers of variation were found in the soil age, horizons, and permafrost layer for prokaryotic and fungal beta diversity. Permafrost was mainly dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, with Polaromonas identified as the most abundant taxon. Thawed permafrost samples indicated increased abundance of several copiotrophic phyla, such as Bacteroidia, suggesting alterations of carbon utilization pathways within eroding permafrost.","2022-03-24","2022-06-27 16:28:46","2022-07-19 19:20:33","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 tests provide the opportunity to leverage stored samples for assessing the oral microbiome. However, these collection kits have not been tested for their accuracy in measuring the oral microbiome. Saliva is highly enriched with human DNA and reducing it prior to shotgun sequencing may increase the depth of bacterial reads. We examined both the effect of saliva collection method and sequence processing on measurement of microbiome depth and diversity by 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomics. We collected 56 samples from 22 subjects. Each subject provided saliva samples with and without preservative, and a subset provided a second set of samples the following day. 16S rRNA gene (V4) sequencing was performed on all samples, and shotgun metagenomics was performed on a subset of samples collected with preservative with and without human DNA depletion before sequencing. We observed that the beta diversity distances within subjects over time was smaller than between unrelated subjects, and distances within subjects were smaller in samples collected with preservative. Samples collected with preservative had higher alpha diversity measuring both richness and evenness. Human DNA depletion before extraction and shotgun sequencing yielded higher total and relative reads mapping to bacterial sequences. We conclude that collecting saliva with preservative may provide more consistent measures of the oral microbiome and depleting human DNA increases yield of bacterial sequences.","2021-11-18","2022-06-27 16:28:46","2022-06-30 17:09:47","","","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; shotgun sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the influence of individual host traits such as age and sex, given specific dietary and social constraints, has been less studied. The objective of this investigation was to determine the associations between an individual's age and sex on the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in wild western lowland gorillas. Materials and Methods Publicly available 16S rRNA data generated from fecal samples of different groups of Gorilla gorilla gorilla in the Central African Republic were downloaded and bioinformatically processed. The groups analyzed included habituated, partially habituated and unhabituated gorillas, sampled during low fruit (dry, n = 28) and high fruit (wet, n = 82) seasons. Microbial community analyses (alpha and beta diversity and analyses of discriminant taxa), in tandem with network-wide approaches, were used to (a) mine for specific age and sex based differences in gut bacterial community composition and to (b) asses for gut community modularity and bacterial taxa with potential functional roles, in the context of seasonal food variation, and social group affiliation. Results Both age and sex significantly influenced gut microbiome diversity and composition in wild western lowland gorillas. However, the largest differences were observed between infants and adults in habituated groups and between adults and immature gorillas within all groups, and across dry and wet seasons. Specifically, although adults always showed greater bacterial richness than infants and immature gorillas, network-wide analyses showed higher microbial community complexity and modularity in the infant gorilla gut. Sex-based microbiome differences were not evident among adults, being only detected among immature gorillas. Conclusions The results presented point to a dynamic gut microbiome in Gorilla spp., associated with ontogeny and individual development. Of note, the gut microbiomes of breastfeeding infants seemed to reflect early exposure to complex, herbaceous vegetation. Whether increased compositional complexity of the infant gorilla gut microbiome is an adaptive response to an energy-limited diet and an underdeveloped gut needs to be further tested. Overall, age and sex based gut microbiome differences, as shown here, maybe mainly attributed to access to specific feeding sources, and social interactions between individuals within groups.","2019-07","2022-06-27 16:28:46","2022-07-19 17:51:32","","575-585","","3","169","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-primate gut; var-age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied squash (Cucurbita pepo L.) root microbiome under historically arid and humid sites, both in situ and performing a common garden experiment. Plants were grown in soils from sites with different drought levels, using in situ collected soils as the microbial source. We described and analyzed bacterial diversity by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (N = 48) from the soil, rhizosphere, and endosphere. Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum present in humid and arid samples, while Actinobacteriota abundance was higher in arid ones. The beta-diversity analyses showed split microbiomes between arid and humid microbiomes, and aridity and soil pH levels could explain it. These differences between humid and arid microbiomes were maintained in the common garden experiment, showing that it is possible to transplant in situ diversity to the greenhouse. We detected a total of 1009 bacterial genera; 199 exclusively associated with roots under arid conditions. By 16S and shotgun metagenomics, we identified dry-associated taxa such as Cellvibrio, Ensifer adhaerens, and Streptomyces flavovariabilis. With shotgun metagenomic sequencing of rhizospheres (N = 6), we identified 2969 protein families in the squash core metagenome and found an increased number of exclusively protein families from arid (924) than humid samples (158). We found arid conditions enriched genes involved in protein degradation and folding, oxidative stress, compatible solute synthesis, and ion pumps associated with osmotic regulation. Plant phenotyping allowed us to correlate bacterial communities with plant growth. Our study revealed that it is possible to evaluate microbiome diversity ex-situ and identify critical species and genes involved in plant-microbe interactions in historically arid locations.

Here, a treatment group of conventionally raised laboratory mice is subjected to two periods of western diet (WD) interrupted by a period of standard diet (SD) of the same duration. Beta-diversity analyses show that diet-induced microbiota changes are largely reversible (q = 0.1501; PERMANOVA, weighted-UniFrac comparison of the treatment-SD group to the control-SD group) and repeatable (q = 0.032; PERMANOVA, weighted-UniFrac comparison of both WD treatments). Furthermore, we report that diet switches alter the gut microbiota composition along the length of the intestinal tract in a segment-specific manner, leading to gut segment-specific Firmicutes/Bacteroidota ratios. We identified prevalent and distinct Amplicon Sequencing Variants (ASVs), particularly in genera of the recently described Muribaculaceae, along the gut as well as ASVs that are differentially abundant between segments of treatment and control groups.

However, the overuse of antibiotics increases the spread of drug-resistant bacteria and causes dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. Few studies have addressed the longitudinal effects of antibiotics on the microbiome and host immunity. Materials and Methods: In this study, the short-term effect of fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) and beta-lactam antibiotics (meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and aztreonam) on the gut microbiota of mice was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The susceptibility of Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, and Clostridium butyricum to these antimicrobial agents was assessed using the disc diffusion method. Results: Our results showed that 4-day antibiotic exposure significantly reduced the alpha and beta diversity of gut bacteria and increased serum inflammatory cytokines, and these changes persisted long after antibiotic withdrawal and did not return to pre-treatment levels. Nonetheless, the bacterial community composition tended to return to pre-treatment levels after discontinuing treatment. The tested probiotic strains were resistant to aztreonam but were sensitive to meropenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam. Conclusion: Short-term antibiotic treatment led to significant changes in the intestinal flora with a tendency to recover. The antibiotics had different effects on the intestinal microbial community and probiotic strains. This study provides guidance for the concomitant use of probiotics and antibiotics, and the results emphasize the importance of using broad-spectrum antibiotics responsibly to prevent the long-term disruption of the native microbiota.","2020","2022-06-27 16:28:47","2022-07-19 15:04:33","","4547-4558","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-antibiotics; var-probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diets that are rich in Western style fats have been shown to promote CRC. This study was conducted to investigate the role of intestinal microbiome in American ginseng-mediated CRC chemoprevention in a mouse model. The population and diversity of enteric microbiome were evaluated after the ginseng treatment. Using an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut inflammation and tumorigenesis mouse model, the effects of oral American ginseng on high fat diet-associated enteric pathology were determined. After establishment of a 16S rRNA illumina library from fecal samples, MiSeq sequencing was carried out to reveal the microbial population. The alpha and beta diversities of microbiome were analyzed. American ginseng significantly attenuated AOM/DSS-induced colon inflammation and tumorigenesis by reducing the colitis score and colon tumor multiplicity. The MiSeq results showed that the majority of sequences fell into three phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia. Further, two significant abundance shifts at the family level, Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, were identified to support ginseng's anti-colitis and anti-tumor effects. In addition, alpha and beta diversity data demonstrated that ginseng led to a profound recovery from the AOM/DSS-induced dysbiosis in the microbial community. Our results suggest that the CRC chemopreventive effects of American ginseng are mediated through enteric microbiome population-shift recovery and dysbiosis restoration. Ginseng's regulation of the microbiome balance contributes to the maintenance of enteric homeostasis.","2018-03","2022-06-27 16:28:47","2022-06-30 18:49:12","","302-312","","3","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB) in Mexico is a desert oasis where, perhaps paradoxically, high microbial diversity coincides with extreme oligotrophy. To better understand the effects of nutrients on microbial communities in CCB, a mesocosm experiment was implemented in a stoichiometrically imbalanced pond, Lagunita, which has an average TN:TP ratio of 122 (atomic). The experiment had four treatments, each with five spatial replicates - unamended controls and three fertilization treatments with different nitrogen: phosphorus (N:P) regimes (P only, N:P = 16 and N:P = 75 by atoms). In the water column, quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that P enrichment alone favored proliferation of bacterial taxa with high rRNA gene copy number, consistent with a previously hypothesized but untested connection between rRNA gene copy number and P requirement. Bacterial and microbial eukaryotic community structure was investigated by pyrosequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes from the planktonic and surficial sediment samples. Nutrient enrichment shifted the composition of the planktonic community in a treatment-specific manner and promoted the growth of previously rare bacterial taxa at the expense of the more abundant, potentially endemic, taxa. The eukaryotic community was highly enriched with phototrophic populations in the fertilized treatment. The sediment microbial community exhibited high beta diversity among replicates within treatments, which obscured any changes due to fertilization. Overall, these results showed that nutrient stoichiometry can be an important factor in shaping microbial community structure.","2017-05-30","2022-06-27 16:28:47","2022-06-30 17:06:51","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have mostly been based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which is limited in taxonomic resolution at the genus level and inferred functionality. Herein, we performed a deep shotgun metagenomics study with the aim to obtain a more precise landscape of gut microbiome dysbiosis in HIV-1 infection. A reduced tendency of alpha diversity and significantly higher beta diversity were found in HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to HIV-1-negative controls. Several species, such as Streptococcus anginosus, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and Rothia mucilaginosa, were significantly enriched in the HIV-1-ART group. Correlations were observed between the degree of immunodeficiency and gut microbiome in terms of microbiota composition and metabolic pathways. Furthermore, microbial shift in HIV-1-infected individuals was found to be associated with changes in microbial virulome and resistome. From the perspective of methodological evaluations, our study showed that different DNA extraction protocols significantly affect the genomic DNA quantity and quality. Moreover, whole metagenome sequencing depth affects critically the recovery of microbial genes, including virulome and resistome, while less than 5 million reads per sample is sufficient for taxonomy profiling in human fecal metagenomic samples. These findings advance our understanding of human gut microbiome and their potential associations with HIV-1 infection. The methodological assessment assists in future study design to accurately assess human gut microbiome.","2021-06-25","2022-06-27 16:28:47","2022-07-19 14:52:21","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Multiethnic Cohort Study members completed a validated quantitative food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) at cohort entry (1993-1996) and, for the APS subset, at clinic visit (2013-2015), when they also provided a stool sample. DNA was extracted from stool, and the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Dietary index scores were computed based on the QFFQ and an extensive nutritional database. Using linear regression adjusted for relevant covariates, we estimated associations of dietary quality with microbiome measures and computed adjusted mean values of microbial measures by tertiles of dietary index scores. Results: The 858 men and 877 women of white, Japanese American, Latino, Native Hawaiian, and African American ancestry had a mean age of 69.2 years at stool collection. Alpha diversity according to the Shannon index increased by 1-2% across tertiles of all 4 diet indexesmeasured at clinic visit.

To a large extent, these functions are carried out by highly diverse and dynamic soil microbiomes that are in turn governed by numerous environmental factors including weathering profile and vegetation. In this study, we investigate geophysical and vegetation effects on the microbial communities of iron-rich lateritic soils in the highly weathered landscapes of Western Australia (WA). The study site was a lateritic hillslope in southwestern Australia, where gradual erosion of the duricrust has resulted in the exposure of the different weathering zones. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate soil bacterial community diversity, composition and functioning. We predicted that shifts in the microbial community would reflect variations in certain edaphic properties associated with the different layers of the lateritic profile and vegetation cover. Our results supported this hypothesis, with electrical conductivity, pH and clay content having the strongest correlation with beta diversity, and many of the differentially abundant taxa belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Soil water repellence, which is associated with Eucalyptus vegetation, also affected beta diversity. This enhanced understanding of the natural system could help to improve future crop management in WA since the physicochemical properties of the agricultural soils in this region are inherited from laterites via the weathering and pedogenesis processes.","2019-07-02","2022-06-27 16:28:47","2022-07-19 17:29:12","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-pH; var-salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, we aimed to characterize the gut microbiota in children of normal weight, overweight, and obesity. Methods: Thirty children of normal weight, 35 who were overweight, and 35 with obesity were enrolled from Nanjing, China. We isolated DNA from fecal samples, and employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the diversity and composition of gut microbiota. Results: The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) numbers exhibited a reduction in the gut microbiota abundance with the increase in the body weight. Alpha diversity analysis revealed a sharp decrease in the mean microbial abundance among the three groups (Chao1: F = 5.478, P = 0.006; observed species: F = 7.271, P = 0.001; PD whole tree: F = 8.735, P < 0.001). Beta diversity analysis indicated notable differences in the gut microbial composition between children of normal weight and obesity. However, overweight children had little difference in gut microbiota compared to either children of normal weight or obesity. At the genus level, Oscillospira decreased among the three groups (chi(2) = 10.062, P = 0.001), and Sutterella increased (F = 4.052, P = 0.020). There were many remarkably increased species of gut bacteria in the comparison among three groups, 31 in the normal weight group, 32 in the obese group, and only three species of bacteria were identified in the overweight group. These significantly increased species of gut bacteria may have a close relationship with the progression of obesity. Conclusions: The abundance of species decreased significantly as the BMI increased. Although the gut microbial composition between children of normal weight and obesity was notably different, due to the changing ratio of some microbial communities, gut microbiota in overweight children showed similarities to that of children with normal weight and obesity.","2021-06-08","2022-06-27 16:28:47","2022-06-30 20:31:13","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human gut; var-adiposity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following surface mining, companies are required to restore soil-like profiles that can support the previous land capabilities. The objective of this study was to assess whether the soil prokaryotic alpha diversity (alpha-diversity) and beta-diversity in oil sand soils reconstructed 20 to 30 years previously and planted to one of three vegetation types (coniferous or deciduous trees and grassland) were similar to those found in natural boreal forest soils subject to wildfire disturbance. Prokaryotic alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were assessed using massively parallel sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The beta-diversity, but not the beta-diversity, differed between reconstructed and natural soils. Bacteria associated with an oligotrophic lifestyle were more abundant in natural forest soils, whereas bacteria associated with a copiotrophic lifestyle were more abundant in reconstructed soils. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea were most abundant in reconstructed soils planted with grasses. Plant species were the main factor influencing alpha-diversity in natural and in reconstructed soils. Nitrogen deposition, pH, and plant species were the main factors influencing the beta-diversity of the prokaryotic communities in natural and reconstructed soils. The results highlight the importance of nitrogen deposition and aboveground-belowground relationships in shaping soil microbial communities in natural and reconstructed soils. \textbackslashIMPORTANCE Covering over 800 km(2), land disturbed by the exploitation of the oil sands in Canada has to be restored. Here, we take advantage of the proximity between these reconstructed ecosystems and the boreal forest surrounding the oil sand mining area to study soil microbial community structure and processes in both natural and nonnatural environments. By identifying key characteristics shaping the structure of soil microbial communities, this study improved our understanding of how vegetation, soil characteristics and microbial communities interact and drive soil functions.","2017-05","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-07-19 17:42:07","","","","9","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Microbes play a significant role in the carcass decomposition process. Microcosm burial set-ups were prepared and poultry carcasses were decomposed for 60 days in unsterilized and sterilized soil, incubated under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The moisture content, pH, alpha and beta diversity were affected by the soil microbial community and oxygen availability during the decomposition of poultry carcasses. The bacterial taxa composition was also altered during the poultry carcass decomposition. These changes suggested that the soil with an intact microbial community and oxygen availability influenced the bacterial community structure during the decomposition of poultry carcasses. The results of this study provided information on the different bacterial species which might be associated with the decomposition of poultry carcasses.& nbsp;The impact of soil with an intact microbial community and oxygen availability on moisture content, soil pH, and bacterial communities during decomposition of poultry carcasses was investigated. Poultry carcasses were decomposed in soil with or without a microbial community, under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The samples collected in each microcosm burial set-up were analyzed by targeted 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and Amplicon sequence variants (ASV) method. Our results showed that moisture was high in the burial set-ups under anaerobic conditions and pH was high in the burial set-ups under aerobic conditions. Meanwhile, the Chao1 and Shannon index significantly differed between the different burial set-ups and across different time points. In addition, bacterial taxa composition during the early period of decomposition differed from that of the late period. A total of 23 phyla, 901 genera, and 1992 species were identified. Firmicutes was the most dominant phyla in all burial set-ups throughout the decomposition. At day 60, Pseudogracilibacillus was dominant in the burial set-ups under aerobic conditions, while Lentibacillus dominated in the burial set-ups under anaerobic conditions. This study demonstrated that the soil microbial community and availability of oxygen significantly affected the changes in moisture content, pH, and bacterial composition during the decomposition process.","2021-10","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-06-29 17:09:48","","","","10","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-carcass decomposition; biome-soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Potential negative effects include changes in microbial community composition and diversity during early life stages, which can reverse the beneficial roles of gut microbiota for the maintenance of host physiological processes and homeostatic regulation. We characterized the gut microbial community composition and diversity of an ecologically and economically important fish species, the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), during the early larval period in response to weekly treatments using chemotherapeutants commonly used in aquaculture (chloramine-T, hydrogen peroxide, and NaCl2 followed by hydrogen peroxide) relative to untreated controls. The effects of founding microbial community origin (wild stream vs. hatchery water) were also evaluated. Gut communities were quantified using massively parallel next generation sequencing based on the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Members of the phylum Firmicutes (principally unclassified Clostridiales and Clostridium_sensu_stricto) and Proteobacteria were the dominant taxa in all gut samples regardless of treatment. The egg incubation environment (origin) and its interaction with chemotherapeutant treatment were significantly associated with indices of microbial taxonomic diversity. We observed large variation in the beta diversity of lake sturgeon gut microbiota between larvae from eggs incubated in hatchery and wild (stream) origins based on nonmetric dimensional scaling (NMDS). Permutational ANOVA indicated the effects of chemotherapeutic treatments on gut microbial community composition were dependent on the initial source of the founding microbial community. Influences of microbiota colonization during early ontogenetic stages and the resilience of gut microbiota to topical chemotherapeutic treatments are discussed.","2022-05","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-06-30 20:28:34","","","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fish gut; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We addressed this lack by comparing the microbiome from three conjunctival swabs with those of corneal epithelial biopsy. Methods: Twelve eyes (11 patients) were swabbed by calcium alginate swab, cottontipped applicator, and Weck-Cel cellulose sponge before a corneal epithelial biopsy (48 samples). We then performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and universal 16S rRNA gene real-time polymerase chain reaction. Negative/blank controls were used to eliminate contaminants. An analysis was performed to examine the concordance of the three swab types to corneal epithelial biopsy. The effect of patient age on the ocular microbiome as determined by epithelial biopsy was also examined. Results: The ocular microbiome from corneal epithelial biopsies consisted of 31 genera with a relative abundance of 1% or more, including Weisella, Corynebacterium, and Pseudomonas. Of the three swab types, Weck-Cel differed the most from corneal biopsies based on beta-diversity analysis. Cotton swabs were unable to capture the Bacteroides population seen on epithelial biopsy. Therefore, calcium alginate swabs seemed to be the closest to epithelial biopsies. Older patients (>= 65 years old) had higher alpha diversity (P < 0.05) than younger patients. Differential abundance testing showed that there were 18 genera that were differentially abundant between the two age groups, including Streptococcus and eight members of the Proteobacteria phylum. Conclusions: We demonstrate that ocular sampling method and patient age can greatly affect the outcome of sequencing-based analysis of the ocular microbiome.

Recent studies have sought to both characterize and understand the links between disease and the microbiome. Probiotic treatment may correct for these microbial imbalances and, in turn, mitigate disease. However, the criteria for probiotic supplementation in NICU's in North Queensland, Australia limits its usage to the most premature (<32 weeks gestation) and small for gestational age infants (<1,500 g). Here we use a combination of amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to compare the gut microbiome of infants who fulfill the criteria for probiotic-treatment and those who do not. The aims of this study were to determine if probiotic-supplemented preterm infants have significantly different taxonomic and functional profiles when compared to non-supplemented preterm infants at discharge. MethodsPreterm infants were recruited in North Queensland, Australia, with fecal samples collected just prior to discharge (36 +/- 0.5 weeks gestation), to capture potential changes that could be probiotic induced. All samples underwent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, with a subset also used for shotgun metagenomics. Mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of probiotics on alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomic abundance, whilst accounting for other known covariates. ResultsMixed effects modeling demonstrated that probiotic treatment had a significant effect on overall community composition (beta diversity), characterized by greater alpha diversity and differing abundances of several taxa, including Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, in supplemented infants. ConclusionLate preterm-infants who go without probiotic-supplementation may be missing out on stabilizing-effects provided through increased alpha diversity and the presence of commensal microbes, via the use of probiotic-treatment. These findings suggest that late-preterm infants may benefit from probiotic supplementation. More research is needed to both understand the consequences of the differences observed and the long-term effects of this probiotic-treatment.","2022-03-07","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-07-19 14:52:05","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is especially true for groundwater environments, which have been understudied in this context relative to other non-subsurface habitats. Here, we analyzed microbial community composition based on exact 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from four geographically separated aquifers located in different regions along a latitudinal transect of similar to 700 km across Germany. Using a combination of variation partitioning and ecological null models revealed that differences in microbial community composition were mainly the product of selection imposed by local environmental conditions and to a smaller but still significant extent dispersal limitation and drift across regions. Only similar to 23% of the total variation in microbial community composition remained unexplained, possibly due to underestimated effects of dispersal limitation among local communities within regions and temporal drift.

A better understanding of microbial composition and diversity pattern in coastal mangrove wetlands in relation to physicochemical and spatial-temporal influences could provide more insights into the ecological functions of microbes in coastal wetlands. In this study, seasonal variations of microbial communities within sediment profiles from two sediment types (mangrove forest and intertidal mudflats) at three sampling locations in coastal Mai Po wetland were characterized using MiSeq high throughput sequencing and 16S rRNA quantitative PCR methods. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance showed clear decreasing trends with increasing depth for all sites, seasonality and sediment types. There is a weak seasonal dynamic of bacterial and archaeal community abundance in both seasons. Seasonality imposed more influence on the beta diversity pattern of bacterial community than archaeal community. The five most abundant phyla within bacterial and archaeal community remain stable between two distinctive seasons. Sediment depth and seasonality are the most influential factors affecting bacterial community composition and diversity. The pH is the most influential factor on shaping the archaeal community. Stratified distribution of bacterial community including aerobic and anaerobic bacterial taxa is largely represented in the surface layers and the subsurface layers, respectively. For archaeal stratification, Thaumarchaeota Marine Group I is the dominant member in surface sediments while Bathyarchaeota and MBG-B dominate in subsurface sediments. Such stratified distribution patterns are irrespective of sediment types, sampling locations or seasonality, but significantly correlated to the sediment depth, which might be shaped by oxygen availability and the distribution of other terminal electron accepters along the depth profile.","2017-11-02","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-07-19 17:35:47","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-pH; var-seasons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the factors shaping skin-microbiome interactions are still insufficiently characterized. This contrasts with the broader knowledge about factors influencing gut microbiota. Objectives We aimed to investigate major patterns of association of host traits, lifestyle and environmental factors with skin bacteria in two German populations. Methods This is a cross-sectional study with 647 participants from two population-based German cohorts, PopGen (n = 294) and KORA FF4 (n = 353), totalling 1794 skin samples. The V1-V2 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene were sequenced. Associations were tested with two bacterial levels, community (beta diversity) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Results We validated known associations of the skin microbiota with skin microenvironment, age, body mass index and sex. These factors were associated with beta diversity and abundance of ASVs in PopGen, which was largely replicated in KORA FF4. Most intriguingly, dietary macronutrients and total dietary energy were associated with several ASVs. ASVs were also associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, skin pH, skin type, transepidermal water loss, education and several environmental exposures, including hours spent outdoors. Associated ASVs included members of the genera Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus.

Samples from bulk water and biofilm were used to assess principles governing microbial community assembly and the value of amplicon sequencing to water utilities. Individual phyla relationships were explored to identify competitive or synergistic factors governing DWDS microbiomes. The relative importance of stochasticity in the assembly of the DWDS microbiome was considered to identify the significance of source and treatment in determining communities in DWDS. Treatment of water significantly reduces overall species abundance and richness, with chlorination of water providing the most impact to individual taxa relationships. The assembly of microbial communities in the bulk water of the source, primary treatment process and DWDS is governed by more stochastic processes, as is the DWDS biofilm. DWDS biofilm is significantly different from bulk water in terms of local contribution to beta diversity, type and abundance of taxa present. Water immediately post chlorination has a more deterministic microbial assembly, highlighting the significance of this process in changing the microbiome, although elevated levels of stochasticity in DWDS samples suggest that this may not be the case at customer taps. 16S rRNA sequencing is becoming more routine, and may have several uses for water utilities, including: detection and risk assessment of potential pathogens such as those within the genera of Legionella and Mycobacterium; assessing the risk of nitrification in DWDS; providing improved indicators of process performance and monitoring for significant changes in the microbial community to detect contamination. Combining this with quantitative methods like flow cytometry will allow a greater depth of understanding of the DWDS microbiome.","2022-04-01","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-07-19 17:57:39","","","","","212","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: To examine intraindividual changes in fecal microbiome and metabolites among patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or vertical sleeve gastrectomy. Setting: Observational study. Methods: Twenty patients were enrolled and provided stool samples before and 1 week, 1 month, and/or 3 months after surgery. Shallow shotgun metagenomics and untargeted fecal metabolomics were performed. Zero-inflated generalized additive models and linear mixed models were applied to identify fecal microbiome and metabolites changes, with adjustment for potential confounders and correction for multiple testing. Results: We enrolled 16 women and 4 men, including 16 white and 4 black participants (median age = 45 years; presurgery body mass index = 47.7 kg/m(2)). Ten patients had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 10 had vertical sleeve gastrectomy, and 14 patients provided postsurgery stool samples. Of 47 samples, median sequencing depth was 6.3 million reads and 1073 metabolites were identified. Microbiome alpha-diversity increased after surgery, especially at 3 months. Significant genus-level changes included increases in Odoribacter, Streptococcus, Anaerotruncus, Alistipes, Klebsiella, and Bifidobacterium, while decreases in Bacteroides, Coprocosccus, Dorea, and Faecalibacterium. Large increases in Streptococcus, Akkermansia, and Prevotella were observed at 3 months. Beta-diversity and fecal metabolites were also changed, including reduced caffeine metabolites, indoles, and butyrate. Conclusions: Despite small sample size and missing repeated samples in some participants, our pilot study showed significant postsurgery changes in fecal microbiome and metabolites among bariatric surgery patients. Future large-scale, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate gut microbial changes and their associations with metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery.

The Bohai Bay is a typical semi-enclosed bay located in the north of China, surrounding by the metropolitan area with anthropogenic disturbances made it a complex marine coastal system with pollution gradients, where the distributions and determinants of bacterioplankton communities remain unclear. In this study, we collected surface water samples from 19 sites across Bohai Bay at about 100 km scale to investigate the relative roles of local environments and regional spatial factors in shaping bacterioplankton community composition (BCC). The environmental parameters in the sampling region showed gradient change according to the geographic variation. Several abundant OTUs were significantly correlated with the pollution parameters in the studied area, and 16 OTUs of them showed distinct distribution pattern in different polluted regions with obvious geographic segmentation, which indicated the effects of pollution gradient and dispersal limitation on specific taxon. The BCCs did not show obviously clustering effect between different polluted regions, which indicated the complexity for explaining the BCC variation in the studied region. The partial Mantel test revealed stronger spatial effects on beta diversity than those of local environmental factors, which indicated that dispersal limitation accounted more for the beta diversity than environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, variation partitioning analysis (VPA) conducted by combining the environmental variables, linear trends, and principal coordinates of the variables from neighbor matrices (PCNM) showed that it was the joint effects of environmental and spatial factors contributed to the explained variation of BCC in the studied area. Considering the special human geography characteristics of Bohai Bay, the unmeasured biotic/abiotic factors, stochastic factors, and anthropogenic disturbances may be responsible for the unexplained variation of the BCC.","2020-04","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-07-19 17:36:14","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor oral hygiene is a known risk factor for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a virally associated head and neck cancer endemic to southern China. We explored the relationship between NPC and the oral microbiome using 16S rRNA sequencing in a study of 499 NPC patients and 495 population-based age and sex frequency-matched controls from an area of endemicity of Southern China. We found a significant reduction in community richness in cases compared to that in controls. Differences in the overall microbial community structure between cases and controls could not be explained by other potential confounders; disease status explained 5 times more variation in the unweighted Uni-Frac distance than the next most explanatory variable. In feature-based analyses, we identified a pair of coexcluding Granulicatella adiacens amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) which were strongly associated with NPC status and differed by a single nucleotide. The G. adiacens variant an individual carried was also associated with the overall microbial community based on beta diversity. Co-occurrence analysis suggested the two G. adiacens ASVs sit at the center of two coexcluding clusters of closely related organisms. Our results suggest there are differences in the oral microbiomes between NPC patients and healthy controls, and these may be associated with both a loss of microbial diversity and niche specialization among closely related commensals. IMPORTANCE The relationship between oral health and the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was previously established. However, the role of oral microbiome has not been evaluated in the disease in a large epidemiological study. This paper clearly establishes a difference in the oral microbiomes between NPC patients and healthy controls which cannot be explained by other confounding factors. It furthermore identifies a pair of closely related coexcluding organisms associated with the disease, highlighting the importance of modern methods for single-nucleotide resolution in 16S rRNA sequence characterization. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first examples of cancer-associated niche specialization of the oral microbiome.","2020-08","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-06-30 19:53:26","","","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diet of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) is comprised almost exclusively of foliage from the genus Eucalyptus (family Myrtaceae). Eucalyptus produces a wide variety of potentially toxic plant secondary metabolites which have evolved as chemical defences against herbivory. The koala is classified as an obligate dietary specialist, and although dietary specialisation is rare in mammalian herbivores, it has been found elsewhere to promote a highly-conserved but low-diversity gut microbiome. The gut microbes of dietary specialists have been found sometimes to enhance tolerance of dietary PSMs, facilitating competition-free access to food. Although the koala and its gut microbes have evolved together to utilise a low nutrient, potentially toxic diet, their gut microbiome has not previously been assessed in conjunction with diet quality. Thus, linking the two may provide new insights in to the ability of the koala to extract nutrients and detoxify their potentially toxic diet. Method. The 16S rRNA gene was used to characterise the composition and diversity of faecal bacterial communities from a wild koala population (n = 32) comprising individuals that predominately eat either one of two different food species, one the strongly preferred and relatively nutritious species Eucalyptus viminalis, the other comprising the less preferred and less digestible species Eucalyptus obliqua. Results. Alpha diversity indices indicated consistently and significantly lower diversity and richness in koalas eating E. viminalis. Assessment of beta diversity using both weighted and unweighted UniFrac matrices indicated that diet was a strong driver of both microbial community structure, and of microbial presence/absence across the combined koala population and when assessed independently. Further, principal coordinates analysis based on both the weighted and unweighted UniFrac matrices for the combined and separated populations, also revealed a separation linked to diet. During our analysis of the OTU tables we also detected a strong association between microbial community composition and host diet. We found that the phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were co-dominant in all faecal microbiomes, with Cyanobacteria also co-dominant in some individuals; however, the E. viminalis diet produced communities dominated by the genera Parabacteroides and/or Bacteroides, whereas the E. obliqua-associated diets were dominated by unidentified genera from the family Ruminococcaceae. Discussion. We show that diet differences, even those caused by differential consumption of the foliage of two species from the same plant genus, can profoundly affect the gut microbiome of a specialist folivorous mammal, even amongst individuals in the same population. We identify key microbiota associated with each diet type and predict functions within the microbial community based on 80 previously identified Parabacteroides and Ruminococcaceae genomes.","2019-04-01","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-07-18 22:08:50","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-marsupial gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to determine the relationship between the gut microbiome composition and metabolic functions and IR in children with obesity. In a cross-sectional study, fecal samples from children with obesity (10-16 years old) were collected for taxonomical and functional analysis of the fecal microbiome using shotgun metagenomics. The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was determined using fasting glucose and insulin. Associations between HOMA-IR and alpha-diversity measures as well as metabolic pathways were evaluated using Spearman correlations; relationships between HOMA-IR and beta-diversity were assessed by permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Twenty-one children (nine males; median: age = 12.0 years; BMI z-score = 2.9; HOMA-IR = 3.6) completed the study. HOMA-IR was significantly associated with measures of alpha-diversity but not with beta-diversity. Children with higher HOMA-IR exhibited lower overall species richness, Firmicutes species richness, and overall Proteobacteria species Shannon diversity. Furthermore, HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with the abundance of pathways related to the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides, amino acids, and short-chain fatty acids, whereas positive correlations between HOMA-IR and the peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathways were observed. In conclusion, insulin resistance was associated with decreased microbial alpha-diversity measures and abundance of genes related to the metabolic pathways.

APOE4 is robustly associated with increased AD risk compared to the neutral APOE3 and protective APOE2. APOE alleles have also been associated with differential inflammation and gastrointestinal recovery after insult in human and murine studies, leading us to hypothesize that APOE alleles impact the gut microbiome. Methods: To assess this hypothesis, we compared 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon-based microbiome profiles in a cohort of mice that were homozygous for APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4, and included both males and females as well as carriers and non-carriers of five familial AD (5xFAD) mutations. Fecal samples were analyzed from mice at 4 and 6 months of age. APOE genotype, as well as sex and 5xFAD status, was then tested for influence on alpha diversity (Shannon H index) and beta diversity (principal coordinate analyses and PERMANOVA). A Random Forest analysis was used to identify features that predicted APOE, sex and 5xFAD status. Results: The richness and evenness (alpha diversity) of the fecal microbiome was not robustly associated with APOE genotype, 5xFAD status or sex. In contrast, microbial community composition (beta-diversity) was consistently and strongly associated with APOE genotype. The association between beta-diversity and sex or 5xFAD status was less consistent and more modest. Comparison of the differences underlying APOE effects showed that the relative abundance of multiple bacterial taxa was significantly different as a function of APOE genotype. Conclusions: The structure of the gut microbiome was strongly and significantly associated with APOE alleles in this murine model. Further evaluation of these findings in humans, as well as studies evaluating the impact of the APOE-associated microbiota on AD-relevant phenotypes in murine models, will be necessary to determine if alterations in the gut microbiome represent a novel mechanism whereby APOE genotype impacts AD.","2020-02-14","2022-06-27 16:28:48","2022-06-30 18:50:14","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonculture 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing suggests important racial differences and pregnancy specific changes in the vaginal microbial communities. A recent study examining the association of the vaginal microbiome and preterm birth documented important findings but was performed in a predominantly white cohort. Given the important racial differences in bacterial communities within the vagina as well as persistent racial disparities in preterm birth, it is important to examine cohorts with varied demographic compositions. OBJECTIVE: To characterize vaginal microbial community characteristics in a large, predominantly African-American, longitudinal cohort of pregnant women and test whether particular vaginal microbial community characteristics are associated with the risk for subsequent preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: This is a nested case-control study within a prospective cohort study of women with singleton pregnancies, not on supplemental progesterone, and without cervical cerclage in situ. Serial mid-vaginal swabs were obtained by speculum exam at their routine prenatal visits. Sequencing of the V1V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on the Roche 454 platform. Alpha diversity community characteristics including richness, Shannon diversity, and evenness as well as beta diversity metrics including Bray Curtis Dissimilarity and specific taxon abundance were compared longitudinally in women who delivered preterm to those who delivered at term. RESULTS: A total of 77 subjects contributed 149 vaginal swabs longitudinally across pregnancy. Participants were predominantly AfricanAmerican (69%) and had a preterm birth rate of 31%. In subjects with subsequent term delivery, the vaginal microbiome demonstrated stable community richness and Shannon diversity, whereas subjects with subsequent preterm delivery had significantly decreased vaginal richness, diversity, and evenness during pregnancy (P<. 01). This change occurred between the first and second trimesters. Within-subject comparisons across pregnancy showed that preterm birth is associated with increased vaginal microbiome instability compared to term birth. No distinct taxa were associated with preterm birth. CONCLUSION: In a predominantly African-American population, a significant decrease of vaginal microbial community richness and diversity is associated with preterm birth. The timing of this suppression appears early in pregnancy, between the first and second trimesters, suggesting that early gestation may be an ecologically important time for events that ordain subsequent term and preterm birth outcomes.","2017-09","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-06-30 17:01:00","","","","3","217","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human vagina; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Noise and infrastructure often change behavior and community composition, with potential physical costs such as decreased condition. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these patterns are virtually unknown. One potential driver of condition within a species is the diversity of the gut microbiome. Here, we investigate how the urban habitat affects the gut microbiome of White-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) males using spatial analyses of land cover (impervious, scrub, grass, and trees) at the regional level and territory level in urban San Francisco, CA and nearby rural Point Reyes, California. We hypothesized that urbanization of habitats affects gut microbial composition and diversity, potentially through direct effects on diet and/or indirect environmental effects. We measured gut microbial community diversity from 16s rRNA sequences amplified from cloacal swabs. We find that the urban and rural male gut microbiomes are significantly different, such that the urban gut microbiome is more diverse than the rural gut microbiome. This relationship may be due to more variable land cover types in urban habitats as compared to rural habitats, which are mainly composed of native scrub. We do not find support for regional impervious cover affecting the gut microbiome, but the more precise territory level analyses show that higher tree cover correlates with increased alpha diversity and impervious cover correlates with relative abundances of gut microbial taxa (Unifrac beta diversity).

Despite the reported link between the composition of vaginal microbiome and PTD, previous studies were inconsistent in their conclusions and utilized non-uniform designs. We performed an independent case-control study carried out on the Slovenian population, where we re-evaluated the role of the vaginal microbiome in PTD. Methods: Vaginal microbiomes of pregnant women who delivered preterm were compared to those delivered at term to examine differences in the microbial richness, diversity, and differential abundance of specific taxa. We obtained vaginal swab samples from 155 Caucasian women who were classified as either term (>= 38(0/7) weeks, n = 107) or preterm (<= 36(6/7) weeks, n = 48) in exclusion of any other medical or obstetric conditions. The vaginal microbiomes of these women were characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region on the MiSeq platform. Results: Women who experienced PTD had a higher microbial richness (Chao1, P = 0.011) and alpha diversity (Shannon, P = 0.00059) than women with term deliveries. We report that overall vaginal microbial community composition (beta-diversity) was significantly different by delivery gestational age category (P-Weighted Unifrac < 0.001). Women who delivered preterm had decreased Lactobacilli spp. abundance as well as increased abundance of Gardnerella and other bacterial vaginosis (BV) and aerobic vaginitis (AV) associated genera including Atopobium, Sneathia, Gemella, Megasphaera, Dorea, Streptococcus, and Escherichia/Shigella. Conclusions: In the present study, we provide further evidence that vaginal microbiome composition is associated with PTD.","2019-09-10","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-06-29 17:15:50","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human vagina; var-birth mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is limited knowledge regarding the impact of high doses of radiation, which can occur as a result of cancer radiation therapy, nuclear accidents or intentional release of a nuclear or radioactive weapon, on the composition of the gut microbiome. Therefore, we sought to analyze alterations to the gut microbiome of nonhuman primates (NHPs) exposed to high doses of radiation. Fecal samples were collected from 19 NHPs (Chinese rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta) 1 day prior and 1 and 4 days after exposure to 7.4Gy cobalt-60 gamma-radiation (LD70-80/60). The 16S V4 rRNA sequences were extracted from each sample, followed by bioinformatics analysis using the QIIME platform.ResultsAlpha Diversity (Shannon Diversity Index), revealed no major difference between pre- and post-irradiation, whereas Beta diversity analysis showed significant differences in the microbiome after irradiation (day +4) compared to baseline (pre-irradiation). The Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio, a factor known to be associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, decreased from 1.2 to less than 1 post-radiation exposure. Actinobacillus, Bacteroides, Prevotella (Paraprevotellaceae family) and Veillonella genera were significantly increased by more than 2-fold and Acinetobacter and Aerococcus genus were decreased by more than 10-fold post-irradiation. Fifty-two percent (10/19) of animals exposed to radiation demonstrated diarrhea at day 4 post-irradiation. Comparison of microbiome composition of feces from animals with and without diarrhea at day 4 post-irradiation revealed an increase in Lactobacillus reuteri associated with diarrhea and a decrease of Lentisphaerae and Verrucomicrobioa phyla and Bacteroides in animals exhibiting diarrhea. Animals with diarrhea at day 4 post-irradiation, had significantly lower levels of Lentisphaere and Verrucomicrobia phyla and Bacteroides genus at baseline before irradiation, suggesting a potential association between the prevalence of microbiomes and differential susceptibility to radiation-induced diarrhea.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that substantial alterations in the microbiome composition of NHPs occur following radiation injury and provide insight into early changes with high-dose, whole-body radiation exposure. Future studies will help identify microbiome biomarkers of radiation exposure and develop effective therapeutic intervention to mitigate the radiation injury.","2021-03-29","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-07-19 14:47:48","","","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-primate gut; var-disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To investigate replacement protein sources in feeds for black tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon, three isonitrogenous, isoenergetic diets were tested in a randomised blind trial using fisheries by-product meal, cattle and poultry by-product meal and soybean meal as the major protein. Juvenile P. monodon (1.46 +/- 0.28 g, 24 per tank, 4 tanks per treatment) were acclimatised on reference diet for 2 weeks, weighed, then fed experimental diets for two weeks. Elevated temperature, pH and salinity was applied for a further two weeks. Feed conversion ratio was significantly higher in animals fed soybean meal-based diet (F (2,9) = 21.7, p < 0.001). To determine any effect of diet on intestinal microbiome the V6-V8 region of the 16s rRNA gene was sequenced on arrival from the farm, at the end of acclimatisation, 24 h after starting test feeds, after 2 weeks on test feeds and after stress period. We found no significant effect of diet on alpha diversity of the midgut microbiota, and no correlation between stress resilience, diet and gut microbiome diversity. However, time had a significant impact on beta diversity throughout the experiment across all three diets (p < 0.001), with the most abundant genera on arrival from the farm being from the genera Photobacterium and Vibrio while the relative abundance of members of the Rhodobacteraceae, Pseudoalteromonadaceae, Mycoplasmataceae and Flavobacteriaceae increased throughout the trial and were also found in the seawater supply. Changing only the protein in the diet is not sufficient to impact gut microbiome, even when animal growth and feed conversion is severely compromised by the diet.

Bacterial community composition and structure were analysed with alpha and beta diversity metrics. A total of 25,658 operational taxonomic units at 97% similarity were assigned to eight phyla, 44 families, 61 genera and 94 species of microbes. The Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all populations. Meanwhile, the genera Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, isolated in this study, were previously found in the rectum of other fruit bats. Our analyses suggest that Redang Island and Langkawi Island have high bacteria diversity.

Objectives: We set out to identify reproducible relationships between diet and gut microbial community composition in a diverse, healthy US adult cohort. Methods: We collected 2 to 3 automated self-administered 24-hour dietary recalls over 10-14 days, together with a single stool sample, from 343 healthy adults in a cross-sectional phenotyping study. This study examined a multi-ethnic cohort balanced for age (18-65 years), sex, and BMI (18.5-45 kg/m(2)). Dietary data were edited to a tree format according to published methods. The tree structure was annotated with the average total grams of dry weight, fat, protein, carbohydrate, or fiber from each food item reported. The alpha and beta diversity measurements, calculated using the tree structure, were analyzed relative to the microbial community diversity, determined by a Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 2 analysis of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA V4 region, sequenced from stool samples. K-means clustering was used to form groups of individuals consuming similar diets, and gut microbial communities were compared among groups using differential expression analysis for sequence count data. Results: The alpha diversity of diet dry weight was significantly correlated with the gut microbial community alpha diversity (r = 0.171). The correlation improved when diet was characterized using grams of carbohydrates (r = 0.186) or fiber (r= 0.213). Bifidobacterium was enriched with diets containing higher levels of total carbohydrate from cooked grains. Lachnospira, was enriched with diet patterns containing high consumption of fiber from fruits excluding berries. Conclusions: The tree structure, annotated with grams of carbohydrate, is a robust analysis method for comparing self-reported diet to the gut microbial community composition. This method identified consumption of fiber from fruit robustly associated with an abundance of pectinolytic bacterial genus, Lachnospira, in the guts of healthy adults.","2022-03-03","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-06-28 20:30:23","","779-788","","3","152","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha-Phylogenetic Diversity; biome-human gut; dist-Aitchison Distance; dist-unweighted UniFrac distance; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the effects of diets for malabsorbed sugars on gut microbiota signatures have not been studied, and associations with clinical outcomes in IBS have not been characterized. 22 IBS patients positively tested for either lactose-, fructose-, sorbitol- or combined malabsorptions were subjected to 2-weeks sugar elimination and subsequent 4-weeks re-introduction. 7 IBS patients tested negative for sugar malabsorption were used as controls. Nutrition and clinical symptoms were recorded throughout the study. Fecal samples were serially collected for 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun-metagenome sequencing. Dietary intervention supervised by nutrition counseling reduced IBS symptoms during the elimination and tolerance phases. Varying clinical response rates were observed between subjects, and used to dichotomize our cohort into visual analogue scale (VAS) responders and non-responders. Alpha -and beta-diversity analyzes revealed only minor differences regarding 16S rRNA-based fecal microbiota compositions between responder and non-responder patients during baseline or tolerance phase. In shotgun-metagenome analyzes, however, we analyzed microbial metabolic pathways and found significant differences in pathways encoding starch degradation and complex amino acid biosynthesis at baseline between IBS controls and malabsorbers, and notably, between diet responder and non-responders. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus spp. and Bifidobacterium longum largely informed these metabolic pathways. Our study demonstrates that diet interventions for specific, malabsorbed carbohydrates reshaped the metagenomic composition of the gut microbiota, with a small community of bacterial taxa contributing to these changes rather than a single species.","2020-05-03","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-07-19 17:48:26","","620-631","","3","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-diet; var-disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stool consistency often varies over time, in subjects with and without gastrointestinal disorders, raising the question whether variability in the microbial composition should be considered in microbiota studies. We evaluated within-subject day-to-day variability in stool consistency and the association with the fecal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and healthy subjects, over seven days. Methods Twelve IBS patients and 12 healthy subjects collected fecal samples during seven consecutive days. Stool consistency was determined by the patient-reported Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) and fecal dry weight percentage. 16S rRNA V4 gene sequencing was performed and microbial richness (alpha diversity; Chao1 index, observed number of species, effective Shannon index) and microbial community structure (beta diversity; Bray-Curtis distance, generalized UniFrac, and taxa abundance on family level) were determined. Results Linear mixed-effects models showed significant associations between stool consistency and microbial richness, but no time effect. This implies that between-subject but not within-subject variation in microbiota over time can partially be explained by variation in stool consistency. Redundancy analysis showed a significant association between stool consistency and microbial community structure, but additional linear mixed-effects models did not demonstrate a time effect on this. Conclusion This study supports an association between stool consistency and fecal microbiota, but no effect of day-to-day fluctuations in stool consistency within seven days. This consolidates the importance of considering stool consistency in gut microbiota research, though confirms the validity of single fecal sampling to represent an individual's microbiota at a given time point.

In this study, the microbial communities of Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) collected from aquatic product markets in three cities (Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Jiangmen) of Guangdong Province, China, where raw oysters are popular, were investigated. The plate counts of viable bacteria in oysters collected in the three cities were all approximately 2 log colony-forming units/g. High-throughput sequencing analysis of the V3-V4 region of the 16Sribosomal DNA gene showed a high level of microbial diversity in oysters, as evidenced by both alpha and beta diversity analysis. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla of the microorganisms present in these samples. A variety of pathogenic bacteria, including the fatal foodborne pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, were found, and Vibrio was the dominant genus. Additionally, the relationship between other microbial species and pathogenic microorganisms may be mostly symbiotic in oysters. These data provide insights into the microbial communities of retail oysters in the Guangdong region and indicate a considerable risk related to the consumption of raw oysters.","2021-07-07","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-07-01 14:55:15","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-oysters; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several large cohort studies have focused on the human gut microbiome, large cohort studies of the gut microbiome from Japanese populations are scarce, especially from healthy or non-diseased individuals. We collected stool samples and original survey lifestyle information from 5,843 Japanese individuals through the Mykinso gut microbiome testing service. From the obtained 16S rRNA sequence data derived from stool samples, the ratio and distribution of each taxon were analyzed. The relationship between different epidemiological attributes and gut microbial indicators were statistically analyzed. The qualitative and quantitative indicators of these common gut microbiota were confirmed to be strongly correlated with age, sex, constipation/diarrhea, and history of lifestyle-related diseases. Therefore, we set up a healthy sub-cohort that controlled for these attribute factors and defined reference ranges from the distribution of gut microbial index in that population. Taken together, these results show that the gut microbiota of Japanese people had high beta-diversity, with no single “typical” gut microbiota type. We believe that the reference ranges for the gut microbial indices obtained in this study can be new reference values for determining the balance and health of the gut microbiota of an individual. In the future, it is necessary to clarify the clinical validity of these reference values by comparing them with a clinical disease cohort.","2021","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-07-19 14:53:37","","123-134","","2","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, there has been a rising interest in the role the microbiome plays in atopic dermatitis (AD). Furthermore, metagenomic analysis of microbe-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) has revealed the importance and relevance of microbial EVs in human health. Methods: We compared the diversity and proportion of microbial EVs in the sera of 24 AD patients and 49 healthy controls, and developed a diagnostic model. After separating microbial EVs from serum, we specifically targeted the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rDNA gene for amplification and subsequent sequencing. Results: Alpha and beta diversity between controls and AD patients both differed, but only the difference in beta diversity was significant. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in healthy controls and AD patients, accounting for over 85% of the total serum bacterial EVs. Also, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria relative abundances were significantly different between the AD and control groups. At the genus level, the proportions of Escherichia-Shigella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Enterococcus were drastically altered between the AD and control groups. AD diagnostic models developed using biomarkers selected on the basis of linear discriminant analysis effect size from the class to genus levels all yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of value 1.00. Conclusions: In summary, microbial EVs demonstrated the potential in their use as novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Therefore, future work should investigate larger case and control groups with cross-sectional or longitudinal clinical data to explore the utility and validity of serum microbiota EV-based AD diagnosis.","2020-09","2022-06-27 16:28:49","2022-07-19 17:07:57","","792-805","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human blood; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodology Using shotgun metagenomics, the composition of the microbiome was obtained for two cohorts of obese female Wistar rats (n = 10-12, total of 82) maintained on a high fat diet before and after a 42-day treatment with a panel of four investigatory or approved anti-obesity drugs (tacrolimus/FK506, bupropion, naltrexone and sibutramine), alone or in combination. Results Only sibutramine treatment induced consistent weight loss and improved glycaemic control in the obese rats. Weight loss was associated with reduced food intake and changes to the faecal microbiome in multiple microbial taxa, genes, and pathways. These include increased beta-diversity, increased relative abundance of multiple Bacteroides species, increased Bacteroides/Firmicutes ratio and changes to abundance of genes and species associated with obesity-induced inflammation, particularly those encoding components of the flagellum and its assembly.

Relatedness among samples was assessed using PCoA ordination and Procrustes analyses. Differences in microbial diversity and taxon mean relative proportions were assessed using linear mixed effects models. Core microbiome analyses were also performed to identify stable and consistent microbes of the nasopharynx. Results and Discussion A total of 2,096,584 clean 16S sequences corresponding to an average of 167 OTUs per sample were generated. Representatives of Moraxella*, Staphylococcus*, Dolosigranulum, Corynebacterium, Prevotella, Streptococcus*, Haemophilus*, Fusobacterium* and a Neisseriaceae genus accounted for 86% of the total reads. These nine genera have been previously found in the nasopharynxes of both infants and adults, but in different proportions. OTUs from the five genera highlighted (*) above defined the nasopharyngeal core microbiome at the 95% level. No significant differences in alpha-and beta-diversity were observed between seasons, but bacterial mean relative proportions of Haemophilus, Moraxella, Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium varied significantly between summer-fall and age groups (inter-patient variation). Additionally, OTUs varied significantly within patients between time points in 35 of the 40 patients analyzed. Future cross-sectional studies should be mindful of the temporal dynamics of the nasopharyngeal microbiota.","2017-01-20","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-06-30 17:02:56","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In adults, PPI treatment is associated with Clostridium difficile infections (CDI). In contrast to adults the microbiome of infants develops from sterility at birth toward an adult-like profile in the first years of life. The effect of PPIs on this developing microbiome has never been studied. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of oral PPIs on the fecal microbiome in infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this prospective longitudinal study 12 infants with proven GERD received oral PPIs for a mean period of 18 weeks (range 8-44). Stool samples were collected before (”before PPI”) and 4 weeks after initiation of PPI therapy (”on PPI”). A third sample was obtained 4 weeks after PPI discontinuation (”after PPI”). The fecal microbiome was determined by NGS based 16S rDNA sequencing. This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov(NCT02359604). In a comparison of “before PPI” and “on PPI” neither alpha- nor beta-diversity changed significantly. On the genus level, however, the relative abundances showed a decrease of Lactobacillus and Stenotrophomonas and an increase of Haemophilus. After PPI therapy there was a significant increase of alpha- and beta-diversity. Additionally, the relative abundances of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were significantly changed and correlated to patients' age and the introduction of solid foods. PPI treatment has only minor effects on the fecal microbiome. After discontinuation of PPI treatment the fecal microbiome correlated to patients' age and nutrition.","2017-10-11","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-07-19 17:12:59","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The bio-ecology of this species remains to be elucidated in several dimensions, including gut microbiota that is nowadays recognized as a fundamental component of mammals. In this work, we investigated the gut microbiota of this herpestid by single-molecule real-time sequencing of twenty paired male (n = 10) and female (n = 10) intestinal samples. This culture-independent approach enabled microbial profiling based on 16S rDNA and investigation of taxonomical and functional features. The core gut microbiome of the adult subpopulation was dominated by Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Eight genera were uniquely found in adults and five in non-adults. When comparing gut bacterial communities across sex, four genera were exclusive of females and six uniquely found in males. Despite these compositional distinctions, alpha- and beta-diversity analyses showed no statistically significant differences across sex or between adult and non-adult specimens. However, when function was inferred, males presented a significantly higher abundance of amino acid and citrate cycle metabolic pathways, compared to the significant overrepresentation in females of galactose metabolic pathways. Additionally, adults exhibited a significantly higher abundance of cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathways, while non-adults bared a significant overrepresentation of two-component systems associated with antibiotic synthesis, flagellin and biofilm production, and chemotaxis control. This study adds new insights into the mongoose bio-ecology palette, highlighting taxonomical and functional microbiome dissimilarities across sex and age classes, possibly related to primary production resources and life-history traits that impact on behavior and diet.","2020-03","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-07-18 21:52:13","","","","3","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-mongoose gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although, a diverse microbial community exists within CF airways, little is known about how the CF microbiota influences patient outcomes. We hypothesized that organisms within the CF microbiota are affected by inhaled-antibiotics and baseline microbiome may be used to predict therapeutic response. Methods: Adults with chronic P. aeruginosa infection from four clinics were observed during a single 28 day on/off inhaled-aztreonam cycle. Patients performed serial sputum collection, CF-respiratory infection symptom scores (CRISS), and spirometry. Patients achieving a decrease of >= 2 CRISS by day 28 were categorized as subjective responders (SR). The airway microbiome was defined by Illumina MiSeq analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: Thirty-seven patients (median 37.4years and FEV1 44% predicted) were enrolled. No significant cohort-wide changes in the microbiome were observed between on/off AZLI cycles in either alpha-or beta-diversity metrics. However, at an individual level shifts were apparent. Twenty-one patients (57%) were SR and fourteen patients did not subjectively respond. While alpha-diversity metrics did not associate with response, patients who did not subjectively respond had a higher abundance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, and lower abundance of Haemophilus. Conclusions: The CF microbiome is relatively resilient to AZLI perturbations. However, associated changes were observed at the individual patient level. The relative abundance of key “off-target” organisms associated with subjective improvements suggesting that the microbiome may be used as a tool to predict patient response - potentially improving outcomes.

Objectives Here, we explored the contribution of long-term diet by searching for dietary patterns that would best associate with the gut microbiome in a population-based cohort. Methods Using a priori and a posteriori approaches, we constructed dietary patterns from an FFQ completed by 1800 adults in the American Gut Project. Dietary patterns were defined as groups of participants or combinations of food variables (factors) driven by criteria ranging from individual nutrients to overall diet. We associated these patterns with 16S ribosomal RNA-based gut microbiome data for a subset of 744 participants. Results Compared to individual features (e.g., fiber and protein), or to factors representing a reduced number of dietary features, 5 a posteriori dietary patterns based on food groups were best associated with gut microbiome beta diversity (P <= 0.0002). Two patterns followed Prudent-like diets-Plant-Based and Flexitarian-and exhibited the highest Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) scores. Two other patterns presented Western-like diets with a gradient in HEI-2010 scores. A fifth pattern consisted mostly of participants following an Exclusion diet (e.g., low carbohydrate). Notably, gut microbiome alpha diversity was significantly lower in the most Western pattern compared to the Flexitarian pattern (P <= 0.009), and the Exclusion diet pattern was associated with low relative abundance of Bifidobacterium (P <= 1.2 x 10(-7)), which was better explained by diet than health status. Conclusions We demonstrated that global-diet a posteriori patterns were more associated with gut microbiome variations than individual dietary features among adults in the United States. These results confirm that evaluating diet as a whole is important when studying the gut microbiome. It will also facilitate the design of more personalized dietary strategies in general populations.","2022-02-09","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-06-30 21:01:42","","432-443","","2","115","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Periodontal disease has a microbial etiology, however, the current state of knowledge about the subgingival microbiome in pregnancy is not well understood. ObjectiveTo characterize the structure and diversity of the subgingival microbiome in early and late pregnancy and explore relationships between the subgingival microbiome and preterm birth among pregnant Black women. MethodsThis longitudinal descriptive study used 16S rRNA sequencing to profile the subgingival microbiome of 59 Black women and describe microbial ecology using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We also compared microbiome features across early (8-14 weeks) and late (24-30 weeks) gestation overall and according to gestational age at birth outcomes (spontaneous preterm, spontaneous early term, full term). ResultsIn this sample of Black pregnant women, the top twenty bacterial taxa represented in the subgingival microbiome included a spectrum representative of various stages of biofilm progression leading to periodontal disease, including known periopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. Other organisms associated with periodontal disease reflected in the subgingival microbiome included several Prevotella spp., and Campylobacter spp. Measures of alpha or beta diversity did not distinguish the subgingival microbiome of women according to early/late gestation or full term/spontaneous preterm birth; however, alpha diversity differences in late pregnancy between women who spontaneously delivered early term and women who delivered full term were identified. Several taxa were also identified as being differentially abundant according to early/late gestation, and full term/spontaneous early term births. ConclusionsAlthough the composition of the subgingival microbiome is shifted toward complexes associated with periodontal disease, the diversity of the microbiome remains stable throughout pregnancy. Several taxa were identified as being associated with spontaneous early term birth. Two, in particular, are promising targets of further investigation. Depletion of the oral commensal Lautropia mirabilis in early pregnancy and elevated levels of Prevotella melaninogenica in late pregnancy were both associated with spontaneous early term birth.","2022-05-11","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-07-19 19:18:19","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prokaryotic metacommunities in the bulk soil were strongly affected by pH, base and aluminum saturation, Ca + Mg concentration, the sum of bases, and silt percentage, due to land-use management and natural differences among the soil types. Higher alpha, beta, and gamma diversities were observed in sites with higher soil pH and fertility, such as pasture soils or fertile soils of the state of Acre.

In particular, while there is observational evidence of relationships between both biotic and abiotic conditions and microbial composition and diversity, there have been few experimental tests to determine the relative importance of these two sets of factors at local scales. Here, we report the results of a fully factorial experiment manipulating soil conditions and plant cover on old-field mesocosms across a latitudinal gradient. The largest contributor to beta diversity was site-to-site variation, but, having corrected for that, we observed significant effects of both plant and soil treatments on microbial composition. Separate phyla were associated with each treatment type, and no interactions between soil and plant treatment were observed. Individual soil characteristics and biotic parameters were also associated with overall beta-diversity patterns and phyla abundance. In contrast, soil microbial diversity was only associated with site and not experimental treatment. Overall, plant community treatment explained more variation than soil treatment, a result not previously appreciated because it is difficult to dissociate plant community composition and soil conditions in observational studies across gradients.

Understanding the niche biocathode environment and microbial community is critical for further developing this technology as the biocathode is key to product formation and efficiency. MES is generally operated to enrich a specific functional group (e.g., methanogens or homoacetogens) from a mixed-culture inoculum. However, due to differences in H-2 and CO2 availability across the cathode surface, competition and syntrophy may lead to overall variability and significant beta-diversity within and between replicate reactors, which can affect performance reproducibility. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the distribution and potential spatial variability of the microbial communities in MES methanogenic biocathodes. Triplicate methanogenic biocathodes were enriched in microbial electrolysis cells for 5 months at an applied voltage of 0.7 V. They were then transferred to triplicate dual-chambered MES reactors and operated at -1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for six batches. At the end of the experiment, triplicate samples were taken at different positions (top, center, bottom) from each biocathode for a total of nine samples for total biomass protein analysis and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Microbial community analyses showed that the biocathodes were highly enriched with methanogens, especially the hydrogenotrophic methanogen family Methanobacteriaceae, Methanobacterium sp., and the mixotrophic Methanosarcina sp., with an overall core community representing > 97% of sequence reads in all samples. There was no statistically significant spatial variability (p > 0.05) observed in the distribution of these communities within and between the reactors. These results suggest deterministic community assembly and indicate the reproducibility of electromethanogenic biocathode communities, with implications for larger-scale reactors.","2019-07-31","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-06-30 20:54:38","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key contributor to wine quality and sensorial characteristics development is the microbiota that colonizes grapes and performs alcoholic fermentation. Still, the microbial patterns of wines produced in different geographic regions (terroir) in Cyprus remain unknown. The present study investigated the microbial diversity of five terroirs in Cyprus, two from the PGI Lemesos region [Kyperounta (PDO Pitsilia) and Koilani (PDO Krasochoria)], and three from the PGI Pafos region [Kathikas (PDO Laona Akamas), Panayia, and Statos (PDO Panayia)], of two grape varieties, Xynisteri and Maratheftiko, using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Through a longitudinal analysis, we examined the evolution of the bacterial and fungal diversity during spontaneous alcoholic fermentation. Both varieties were characterized by a progressive reduction in their fungal alpha diversity (Shannon index) throughout the process of fermentation. Additionally, the study revealed a distinct separation among different terroirs in total fungal community composition (beta-diversity) for the variety Xynisteri. Also, Kyperounta terroir had a distinct total fungal beta-diversity from the other terroirs for Maratheftiko. Similarly, a significant distinction was demonstrated in total bacterial diversity between the PGI Lemesos region and the PGI Pafos terroirs for grape juice of the variety Xynisteri. Pre-fermentation, the fungal diversity for Xynisteri and Maratheftiko was dominated by the genera Hanseniaspora, Aureobasidium, Erysiphe, Aspergillus, Stemphylium, Penicillium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Mycosphaerella. During and post-fermentation, the species Hanseniaspora nectarophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora guilliermondii, and Aureobasidium pullulans, became the predominant in most must samples. Regarding the bacterial diversity, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus were the predominant genera for both grape varieties in all stages of fermentation. During fermentation, an increase was observed in the relative abundance of some bacteria, such as Acetobacter, Gluconobacter, and Oenococcus oeni. Finally, the study revealed microbial biomarkers with statistically significant higher relative representation, associated with each geographic region and each grape variety, during the different stages of fermentation.

Beta diversity analyses showed that the microbial communities at the two sites were different. Six dominant phyla and fourteen dominant genera were identified. The most abundant bacterial genera had a significant relationship with the diet and living environment, and some bacterial genera were found to adapt to the plateau environment in which relict gulls live, which enables the relict gulls to use local resources effectively to accumulate energy. Simultaneously, a variety of highly abundant pathogenic bacteria were found, suggesting that these gulls may spread diseases among the local gull population. Certain measures should be taken to protect this species and to prevent the spread of diseases.","2022-04-06","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-07-19 15:03:56","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-bird gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is mainly because fish species distribution often covaries with other biotic and abiotic factors, complicating the study design. We tackled this issue in the northern part of the Jordan River system, in which a few fish species geographically overlap, across steep gradients of water temperature and salinity. Results Using 16S rRNA metabarcoding, we studied the water properties that shape the skin bacterial communities, and their interaction with fish taxonomy. To better characterise the indigenous skin community, we excluded bacteria that were equally abundant in the skin samples and in the water samples, from our analysis of the skin samples. With this in mind, we found alpha diversity of the skin communities to be stable across sites, but higher in benthic loaches, compared to other fish. Beta diversity was found to be different among sites and to weakly covary with the dissolved oxygen, when treated skin communities were considered. In contrast, water temperature and conductivity were strong factors explaining beta diversity in the untreated skin communities. Beta diversity differences between co-occurring fish species emerged only for the treated skin communities. Metagenomics predictions highlighted the microbiome functional implications of excluding the water community contamination from the fish skin communities. Finally, we found that human-induced eutrophication promotes dysbiosis of the fish skin community, with signatures relating to fish health. Conclusions Consideration of the background water microbiome when studying fish skin microbiomes, across varying fish species and water properties, exposes patterns otherwise undetected and highlight among-fish-species differences. We suggest that sporadic nutrient pollution events, otherwise undetected, drive fish skin communities to dysbiosis. This finding is in line with a recent study, showing that biofilms capture sporadic pollution events, undetectable by interspersed water monitoring.","2020-01-31","2022-06-27 16:28:50","2022-07-01 16:12:48","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fish skin; var-salinity; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vega","Alien vs. predator: bacterial challenge alters coral microbiomes unless controlled by Halobacteriovorax predators","PEERJ","","","10.7717/peerj.3315","","Coral microbiomes are known to play important roles in organismal health, response to environmental stress, and resistance to disease. The coral microbiome contains diverse assemblages of resident bacteria, ranging from defensive and metabolic symbionts to opportunistic bacteria that may turn harmful in compromised hosts. However, little is known about how these bacterial interactions influence the mechanism and controls of overall structure, stability, and function of the microbiome. We sought to test how coral microbiome dynamics were affected by interactions between two bacteria: Vibrio coralliilyticus, a known temperature-dependent pathogen of some corals, and Halobacteriovorax, a unique bacterial predator of Vibrio and other gram-negative bacteria. We challenged reef-building coral with V. coralliilyticus in the presence or absence of Halobacteriovorax predators, and monitored microbial community dynamics with 16S rRNA gene profiling time-series. Vibrio coralliilyticus inoculation increased the mean relative abundance of Vibrios by greater than 35% from the 4 to 8 hour time point, but not in the 24 & 32 hour time points. However, strong secondary effects of the Vibrio challenge were also observed for the rest of the microbiome such as increased richness (observed species), and reduced stability (increased beta-diversity). Moreover, after the transient increase in Vibrios, two lineages of bacteria (Rhodobacterales and Cytophagales) increased in coral tissues, suggesting that V. coralliilyticus challenge opens niche space for these known opportunists. Rhodobacterales increased from 6.99% (+/- 0.05 SEM) to a maximum mean relative abundance of 48.75% (+/- 0.14 SEM) in the final time point and Cytophagales from < 0.001% to 3.656%. Halobacteriovorax predators are commonly present at low-abundance on coral surfaces. Based on the keystone role of predators in many ecosystems, we hypothesized that Halobacteriovorax predators might help protect corals by consuming foreign or “alien” gram negative bacteria. Halobacteriovorax inoculation also altered the microbiome but to a lesser degree than V. coralliilyticus, and Halobacteriovorax were never detected after inoculation. Simultaneous challenge with both V. coralliilyticus and predatory Halobacteriovorax eliminated the increase in V. coralliilyticus, ameliorated changes to the rest of the coral microbiome, and prevented the secondary blooms of opportunistic Rhodobacterales and Cytophagales seen in the V. coralliilyticus challenge. These data suggest that, under certain circumstances, host-associated bacterial predators may mitigate the ability of other bacteria to destabilize the microbiome.","2017-05-31","2022-06-27 16:28:51","2022-06-30 19:16:48","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-coral; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to compare the microbial composition of feces. The first sample was collected within 48 h after birth, then once per week until the NEC diagnosis, and finally 1-2 weeks after treatment or 28 days after birth. Results: The alpha diversity of the microbiota in the NEC group was higher than that in the control group. Beta diversity analysis showed that the control group had a higher similarity at the onset of NEC, while the NEC group was distributed in subgroups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size and taxonomic composition analyses indicated that the abundance of Bacteroides and Actinobacteria in NEC infants at birth was much higher than that in the control group, and this trend continued until NEC occurred. At this time, Rhizobiales, Dysgonomonas, Ochrobactrum, Ralstonia, Pelomonas, Acinetobacter, etc., were also more abundant in NEC infants. The upregulated different metabolic pathways in the NEC group were mainly concentrated on degradation/utilization/assimilation, biosynthesis, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy. Conclusions: 1. The microbial community differs according to the time of NEC diagnosis (bounded by 20 days). 2. No single microorganism is related to NEC, and the combined effect of multiple species is of great significance in the occurrence of NEC. Premature infants are easily affected by bacteria living in the environment, and compared with ordinary premature infants, NEC infants have a higher abundance of waterborne bacteria. Therefore, attention should be paid to the contamination of water sources and various ventilator pipelines for premature infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit. 3. An in-depth study of the mode of microbial colonization in premature infants combined with the different functions of various metabolic pathways involved in different microorganisms may be able to identify the cause of NEC.","2021-05-03","2022-06-27 16:28:51","2022-07-19 17:19:15","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpha- and beta-diversity of summer and under-ice hypolimnetic communities were similar, and a seasonal difference was found only when excluding summer hypolimnetic communities. Similarly, in non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), summer and under-ice communities were different even though hypolimnetic communities were similar. Investigating under-ice conditions, the year 2017 showed highest under-ice light and chlorophyll-a while 2021 showed no under-ice light and lowest chlorophyll-a. Under-ice communities were not linked to layer differences implying that a spatial distinction under ice was less important than in summer, especially in years with little or no under-ice light. Most under-ice bacterial classes and ASVs showed direct and indirect dependencies on light availability and primary production. Similarly in NMDS with only under-ice communities, light transparency and primary production were important.

Methods:To establish disease-associated determinants, we performed gut microbiome profiling in BD patients from the Netherlands (n= 19) and Italy (n= 13), matched healthy controls (HC) from the Netherlands (n= 17) and Italy (n= 15) and oral microbiome profiling in Dutch BD patients (n= 18) and HC (n= 15) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Results:In BD stool samples alpha-diversity was conserved, whereas beta-diversity analysis showed no clustering based on disease, but a significant segregation by country of origin. Yet, a significant decrease of unclassifiedBarnesiellaceaeandLachnospiragenera was associated with BD patients compared to HC.

We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify the skin microbial community structure of over 200 individual wild adult European common frogs (Rana temporaria), from ten populations with contrasting history of the lethal disease ranavirosis, caused by emerging viral pathogens belonging to the genus Ranavirus. All populations had similar species richness irrespective of disease history, but populations that have experienced historical outbreaks of ranavirosis have a distinct skin microbiome structure (beta diversity) when compared to sites where no outbreaks of the disease have occurred. At the individual level, neither age, body length, nor sex of the frog could predict the structure of the skin microbiota. Our data potentially support the hypothesis that variation among individuals in skin microbiome structure drive differences in susceptibility to infection and lethal outbreaks of disease.

Here, we investigated the influence of spatial scale on the relative role of stochasticity and determinism in agricultural monocultures consisting only of wheat, thereby minimizing the influence of differences in plant species cover and in cultivation/disturbance regime, extending across a wide range of soils and climates of the North China Plain (NCP). We sampled 243 sites across 1092 km and sequenced the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using MiSeq. We hypothesized that determinism would play a relatively stronger role at the broadest scales, due to the strong influence of climate and soil differences in selecting many distinct OTUs of bacteria adapted to the different environments. In order to test the more general applicability of the hypothesis, we also compared with a natural ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. Results: Our results revealed that the relative importance of stochasticity vs. determinism did vary with spatial scale, in the direction predicted. On the North China Plain, stochasticity played a dominant role from 150 to 900 km (separation between pairs of sites) and determinism dominated at more than 900 km (broad scale). On the Tibetan Plateau, determinism played a dominant role from 130 to 1200 km and stochasticity dominated at less than 130 km. Among the identifiable deterministic factors, soil pH showed the strongest influence on soil bacterial community structure and diversity across the North China Plain. Together, 23.9% of variation in soil microbial community composition could be explained, with environmental factors accounting for 19.7% and spatial parameters 4.1%. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that (1) stochastic processes are relatively more important on the North China Plain, while deterministic processes are more important on the Tibetan Plateau; (2) soil pH was the major factor in shaping soil bacterial community structure of the North China Plain; and (3) most variation in soil microbial community composition could not be explained with existing environmental and spatial factors.

The rhizosphere microbial community plays an important role in maintaining the healthy growth of plants, whereas the composition and dynamics of rhizosphere microbial community under continuous monocropping of cut chrysanthemum have not been fully revealed. In this study, the Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing platform was used to monitor the dynamic changes of rhizosphere microbial communities in four varieties of cut chrysanthemum during 0-3 years of monocropping, and the soil physicochemical properties were also determined. Results showed that continuous monocropping significantly increased the fungal community richness and altered the profiles of the bacterial and fungal communities, leading to variation of community beta-diversity. With the increase of continuous cropping time, biocontrol bacteria decreased, while some plant pathogenic fungi were enriched in the rhizosphere of cut chrysanthemum. FAPROTAX-based functional prediction showed that the abundance of gene related to nitrogen and sulfur metabolism and chitin lysis was reduced in the rhizosphere of cut chrysanthemum. FUNGuild-based fungal function prediction showed that plant pathogenic fungal taxa were increasing in the rhizosphere of cut chrysanthemum, mainly Acremonium, Plectosphaerellaceae, Fusarium, and Cladosporium. Continuous cropping also reduced the content of ammonium nitrogen and increased soil salinity, resulting in deterioration of soil physical and chemical properties, which, together with the transformation of rhizosphere microbial community, became part of the reasons for the continuous cropping obstacle of cut chrysanthemum.","2022-03-16","2022-06-27 16:28:51","2022-07-20 15:36:00","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-environmental; biome-soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No studies have addressed the microbial community composition of cryoconite holes and their associated ecosystem processes on Tibetan glaciers. To further enhance our understanding of these glacial ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau and to examine their role in carbon cycling as the glaciers respond to climate change, we explored the bacterial communities within cryoconite holes associated with three climatically distinct Tibetan Plateau glaciers using Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Cryoconite bacterial communities were dominated by Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Cryoconite bacterial community composition varied according to their geographical locations, exhibiting significant differences among glaciers studied. Regional beta diversity was driven by the interaction between geographic distance and environmental variables; the latter contributed more than geographic distance to the variation in cryoconite microbial communities.

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is mainly characterized by a high altitude, dry, cold, and hypoxic environment. The oral microbiota is subject to selective pressure from the plateau environment, which affects oral health. Only a few studies have focused on the characteristics of oral microbiota in high-altitude humans. We collected saliva samples from 167 Tibetans at four altitudes (2800 to 4500 m) in Tibet to explore the relationship between the high altitude environment and oral microbiota. We conducted a two (high- and ultra-high-altitude) group analysis based on altitude, and adopted the 16S rRNA strategy for high-throughput sequencing. The results show that the alpha diversity of the oral microbiota decreased with altitude, whereas beta diversity increased with altitude. A LEfSe analysis revealed that the oral microbial biomarker of the high-altitude group (<3650 m) was Streptococcus, and the biomarker of the ultra-high-altitude group (>4000 m) was Prevotella. The relative abundance of Prevotella increased with altitude, whereas the relative abundance of Streptococcus decreased with altitude. A network analysis showed that the microbial network structure was more compact and complex, and the interaction between the bacterial genera was more intense in the high altitude group. Gene function prediction results showed that the amino acid and vitamin metabolic pathways were upregulated in the ultra-high-altitude group.

A commonly used biocide in HF, 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA), was studied in microcosms of HF-impacted (HF+) versus HF-unimpacted (HF-) surface water streams to (i) compare the microbial community response, (ii) investigate DBNPA degradation products based on past HF exposure, and (iii) compare the microbial community response differences and similarities between the HF biocides DBNPA and glutaraldehyde. The microbial community responded to DBNPA differently in HF-impacted versus HF-unimpacted microcosms in terms of the number of 16S rRNA gene copies quantified, alpha and beta diversity, and differential abundance analyses of microbial community composition through time. The differences in microbial community changes affected degradation dynamics. HF-impacted microbial communities were more sensitive to DBNPA, causing the biocide and by-products of the degradation to persist for longer than in HF-unimpacted microcosms. A total of 17 DBNPA by-products were detected, many of them not widely known as DBNPA by-products. Many of the brominated by-products detected that are believed to be uncharacterized may pose environmental and health impacts. Similar taxa were able to tolerate glutaraldehyde and DBNPA; however, DBNPA was not as effective for microbial control, as indicated by a smaller overall decrease of 16S rRNA gene copies/ml after exposure to the biocide, and a more diverse set of taxa was able to tolerate it. These findings suggest that past HF activity in streams can affect the microbial community response to environmental perturbation such as that caused by the biocide DBNPA. IMPORTANCE Unconventional oil and gas activity can affect pH, total organic carbon, and microbial communities in surface water, altering their ability to respond to new environmental and/or anthropogenic perturbations. These findings demonstrate that 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA), a common hydraulic fracturing (HF) biocide, affects microbial communities differently as a consequence of past HF exposure, persisting longer in HF-impacted (HF+) waters. These findings also demonstrate that DBNPA has low efficacy in environmental microbial communities regardless of HF impact. These findings are of interest, as understanding microbial responses is key for formulating remediation strategies in unconventional oil and gas (UOG)-impacted environments. Moreover, some DBNPA degradation by-products are even more toxic and recalcitrant than DBNPA itself, and this work identifies novel brominated degradation by-products formed.","2019-11","2022-06-27 16:28:51","2022-07-19 17:41:02","","","","21","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantification of this variation is essential for designing studies of chronic disease. We analyzed 16S ribosomal RNA profiles in paired biological specimens separated by 6 months from 3 studies conducted during 1985-2013 (a National Cancer Institute colorectal cancer study, a Costa Rica study, and the Human Microbiome Project). We evaluated temporal stability by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Sample sizes needed in order to detect microbiome differences between equal numbers of cases and controls for a nested case-control design were calculated on the basis of estimated ICCs. Across body sites, 12 phylum-level ICCs were greater than 0.5. Similarly, 11 alpha-diversity ICCs were greater than 0.5. Fecal beta-diversity estimates had ICCs over 0.5. For a single collection with most microbiome metrics, detecting an odds ratio of 2.0 would require 300-500 cases when matching 1 case to 1 control at P = 0.05. Use of 2 or 3 sequential specimens reduces the number of required subjects by 40%-50% for low-ICC metrics. Relative abundances of major phyla and alpha-diversity metrics have low temporal stability. Thus, detecting associations of moderate effect size with thesemetrics will require large sample sizes. Because beta diversity for feces is reasonably stable over time, smaller sample sizes can detect associations with community composition. Sequential prediagnostic specimens from thousands of prospectively ascertained cases are required to detectmodest disease associations with particular microbiome metrics.","2018-06","2022-06-27 16:28:51","2022-07-19 18:00:36","","1282-1290","","6","187","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-human oral; biome-human skin; biome-human vagina; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Complex soluble carbohydrates are considered ideal for fostering microbiota biodiversity by fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPS). Here we evaluated the growth performance and microbiota composition of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei after dietary intervention using agavin as a FODMAP prebiotic under farming conditions. Adult L. vannamei were raised at a shrimp farm and the effect of agavin supplemented at 2% (AG2) or 10% (AG10) levels were compared to an agavin-free basal diet (BD). After 28 days-trial, the feed conversion ratio, total feed ingested, and protein efficiency ratio was significantly improved on animals fed with AG2. At the same time, no effect on growth performance was observed in AG10. Surprisingly, after sequencing the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene a higher microbial richness and diversity in the hepatopancreas and intestine was found only in those animals receiving the AG10 diet, while those receiving the AG2 diet had a decreased richness and diversity, both diets compared to the BD. The beta diversity analysis showed a clear significant microbiota clustering by agavin diets only in the hepatopancreas, suggesting that agavin supplementation had a more substantial deterministic effect on the microbiota of hepatopancreas than on the intestine. We analyzed the literature to search beneficial microbes for shrimp's health and found sequences for 42 species in our 16S data, being significantly increased Lactobacillus pentosus, Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas synxantha in the hepatopancreas of the AG10 and Rodopseudomonas palustris and Streptococcus thermophiles th1435 in the hepatopancreas of the AG2, both compared to BD. Interestingly, when we analyzed the abundance of 42 beneficial microbes as a single microbial community “meta-community,” found an increase in their abundance as agavin concentration increases in the hepatopancreas. In addition, we also sequenced the DNA of agavin and found 9 of the 42 beneficial microbes. From those, Lactobacillus lactis and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were found in shrimps fed with agavin (both AG2 and AG10), and Lysinibacillus fusiformis in AG10 and they were absent the BD diet, suggesting these three species could be introduced with the agavin to the diet. Our work provides evidence that agavin supplementation is associated with an increase of beneficial microbes for the shrimp microbiota at farming conditions. Our study provides the first evidence that a shrimp prebiotic may selectively modify the microbiota in an organ-dependent effect.","2022-04-16","2022-06-27 16:28:51","2022-06-30 16:56:18","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One mainstay of sedimentary classification is the concept of differential soil and/or paleosol horizons being the result of primarily physical and chemical weathering, with relatively little understanding of how microbial communities between these stratified horizons differ, if at all. In this study we evaluate the differences in microbial community taxonomy and biogeochemical functional potential between stratified soil horizons in an alpine paleosol environment using next-generation sequencing (NGS) shotgun sequencing. Paleosols represent a unique environment to study the effect of differences soil horizon environments on the microbial community due to their relative isolation, and the fact that three distinct stratified soil horizons can be identified within the top 30 cm of the soil. This enables us to assess variation in microbial community composition that will be relatively distinct from variation due to distance alone. We test the hypothesis that variation in soil community composition is linked to variation in the physical and chemical parameters that define stratigraphy. Multivariate statistical analysis of sequencing reads from soil horizons across five sampling sites revealed that 1223 microbial genera vary significantly and consistently in abundance across stratified soil horizons at class level. Specifically Ktedonobacter, Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria responded most strongly to soil depth. Alpha diversity showed a positive correlation with soil depth. Beta diversity, however, did not differ significantly between horizons. Genes involved in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism were found to be more abundant in Ah horizon samples. Closer inspection of carbohydrate metabolism genes revealed that genes involved in CO2 fixation, fermentation and saccharide metabolism decreased in abundance with depth while one-carbon metabolism increased down profile.

There are many factors that can cause data variation and inconsistency during the process of microbiota study, in particular, sample storage conditions and sequencing process. Here, we systemically evaluated the impacts of six fecal sample storage conditions (three non-commercial storage protocols, -80 degrees C, -80 degrees C with 70% ethanol (ET_-80 degrees C), 4 degrees C with 70% ethanol (ET_4 degrees C), and three commercial storage reagents, OMNIgeneGUT OMR-200 (GT) and MGIEasy (MGIE) at room temperature, and Longsee at 4 degrees C (LS) on gut microbiome profile based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In addition, we also investigated the impacts of storage periods (1 and 2 weeks, or 6 months) and sequencing platform on microbiome profile. The efficacy of storage conditions was evaluated by DNA yield and quality, alpha and beta diversity, relative abundance of the dominant and functional bacteria associated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and BAs metabolism. Our current study suggested that -80 degrees C was acceptable for fecal sample storage, and the addition of 70% ethanol had some benefits in maintaining the microbial community structure. Meanwhile, we found that samples in ET_4 degrees C and GT reagents were comparable, both of them introduced some biases in alpha or beta diversity, and the relative abundance of functional bacteria. Samples stored in MGIE reagent resulted in the least variation, whereas the most obvious variations were introduced by LS reagents. In addition, our results indicated that variations caused by storage condition were larger than that of storage time and sequencing platform.

However, the influence of the oral microbiome in neurological processes is much less studied, especially in response to the stimuli, such as smoking, within the oral microenvironment. Additionally, given the complex structural and functional networks in brain, our knowledge about the relationship between microbiome and brain function through specific brain circuits is still very limited. In this pilot study, we leveraged next generation sequencing for microbiome and functional neuroimaging technique to enable the delineation of microbiome-brain network links as well as their relationship to cigarette smoking. Thirty smokers and 30 age- and sex-matched nonsmokers were recruited for 16S sequencing of their oral microbial community. Among them, 56 subjects were scanned by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to derive brain functional networks. Statistical analyses were performed to demonstrate the influence of smoking on the oral microbial composition, functional network connectivity, and the associations between microbial shifts and functional network connectivity alternations. Compared to nonsmokers, we found a significant decrease of beta diversity (P = 6 x 10(-3)) in smokers and identified several classes (Betaproteobacteria, Spirochaetia, Synergistia, and Mollicutes) with significant alterations in microbial abundance. Pathway analysis on the predicted KEGG pathways shows that the microbiota with altered abundance are mainly involved in pathways related to cell processes, DNA repair, immune system, and neurotransmitters signaling. One brain functional network connectivity component was identified to have a significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers (P = 0.032), mainly including connectivity between brain default network and other task-positive networks. This brain functional component was also significantly associated with smoking related microbiota, suggesting a correlated cross-individual pattern between smoking-induced oral microbiome dysbiosis and brain functional connectivity alternation, possibly involving immunological and neurotransmitter signaling pathways. This work is the first attempt to link oral microbiome and brain functional networks, and provides support for future work in characterizing the role of oral microbiome in mediating smoking effects on brain activity.","2019-10-15","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-07-19 18:03:49","","121-131","","","200","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-gut-brain axis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One hundred eighty-four community-dwelling adults (28-97 years) completed validated self-report-based measures of loneliness, wisdom, compassion, social support, and social engagement. Fecal samples were collected and profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. Linear regression analyses, controlling for age and body mass index, revealed that lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of wisdom, compassion, social support, and social engagement were associated with greater phylogenetic richness and diversity of the gut microbiome. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis to investigate multivariate relationships extracted two composite variables.

However, the processes that shape the microbiomes of wildlife are poorly understood, particularly with regard to exposure to environmental contaminants. We used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to quantify how exposure to radionuclides impacts the skin and gut microbiota of a small mammal, the bank vole Myodes glareolus, inhabiting areas within and outside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), Ukraine.ResultsSkin microbiomes of male bank voles were more diverse than females. However, the most pronounced differences in skin microbiomes occurred at a larger spatial scale, with higher alpha diversity in the skin microbiomes of bank voles from areas within the CEZ, whether contaminated by radionuclides or not, than in the skin microbiomes of animals from uncontaminated locations outside the CEZ, near Kyiv. Similarly, irrespective of the level of radionuclide contamination, skin microbiome communities (beta diversity) showed greater similarities within the CEZ, than to the areas near Kyiv. Hence, bank vole skin microbiome communities are structured more by geography than the level of soil radionuclides. This pattern presents a contrast with bank vole gut microbiota, where microbiomes could be strikingly similar among distant (80km of separation), uncontaminated locations, and where differences in microbiome community structure were associated with the level of radioactivity. We also found that the level of (dis)similarity between the skin and gut microbiome communities from the same individuals was contingent on the potential for exposure to radionuclides.ConclusionsBank vole skin and gut microbiomes have distinct responses to similar environmental cues and thus are structured at different spatial scales. Our study shows how exposure to environmental pollution can affect the relationship between a mammalian host's skin and gut microbial communities, potentially homogenising the microbiomes in habitats affected by pollution.","2018-11-26","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-07-19 17:21:38","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; biome-rodent skin; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its establishment at different age groups has not been quantitatively and functionally examined. The knowledge of microbial colonization and its function in the intestinal tract of different-age donkeys is still limited. By applying the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and functional prediction on fecal samples from different-age donkeys, we characterized the gut microbiota during the different age groups. In contrast to the adult donkeys, the gut microbiota diversity and richness of the young donkeys showed significantly less resemblance. The microbial data showed that diversity and richness increased with age, but a highly individual variation of microbial composition was observed at month 1. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed a significant difference across five time points in the feces. The abundance of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, and Odoribacter tended to decrease, while the proportion of Streptococcus was significantly increased with age. For functional prediction, the relative abundance of pathways had a significant difference in the feces across different age groups, for example, Terpenoids and Polyketides and Folding, Sorting, and Degradation (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The analysis of beta diversity (PCoA and LEfSe) and microbial functions predicted with PICRUSt (NSTIs) clearly divided the donkeys into foals (<= 3 months old) and adults (>= 7 months old). Microbial community composition and structure had distinctive features at each age group, in accordance with functional stability of the microbiota. Our findings established a framework for understanding the composition and function of the fecal microbiota to differ between young and adult donkeys.","2020-12-03","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-06-30 21:04:56","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-donkey gut; var-age","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among many factors involved in the composting process, the microbial ecology of the system is the underlying drive of composting and can be influenced by composting management techniques. Pasteurization temperature at the beginning of phase II, in theory, may influence the bacterial community and subsequently the “selectivity” and nutrition of the final substrate. Therefore, this hypothesis was tested by simulation in bioreactors under different pasteurization conditions (57 A degrees C/6 h, 60 A degrees C/2 h, and 68 A degrees C/2 h), simulating conditions adopted by many producers. Bacterial diversity, based on 16S ribosomal RNA obtained by high-throughput sequencing and classified in operational taxonomic units (OTUs), was greater than previously reported using culture-dependent methods. Alpha diversity estimators show a lower diversity of OTUs under a high-temperature pasteurization condition. Bacillales order shows a relatively higher OTU abundance under a high-pasteurization temperature, which also was related to high ammonia emission measurements. On the other hand, beta diversity analysis showed no significantly changes in the bacterial community structure under different conditions. Agaricus bisporus mycelium growth during a standard spawn run period was significantly slower in the compost pasteurized at high temperature. Since the bacterial community structure was not greatly affected by different pasteurization conditions but by-products left (e.g., ammonia) at the end of compost conditioning varied, further studies need to be conducted to determine the functional role of the microbial communities found during substrate preparation for Agaricus bisporus cultivation.","2018-02","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-06-30 16:58:00","","318-330","","2","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-compost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpha (alpha) diversity was evaluated using Shannon diversity index and Pielou evenness index, while beta (beta) diversity was assessed using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) of unweighted Unifrac distances. The potential functional changes of microbiomes were predicted using Tax4Fun. The relative abundance of microbial taxa was compared using Welch's t test.

This study describes the intestinal microbiota of four Argentinian higher termite species with different feeding habits: Microcerotermes strunckii (hardwood), Nasutitermes corniger (softwood), Termes riograndensis (soil organic matter/grass) and Cornitermes cumulans (grass) by deep sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA and ITS genes. In addition, we have performed a taxonomic and gut community structure comparison incorporating into the analysis the previously reported microbiomes of additional termite species with varied diets. The bacterial phylum Spirochaetes was dominant in the guts of M. strunckii, N. corniger and C. cumulans, whereas Firmicutes predominated in the T. riograndensis gut microbiome. A single bacterial genus, Treponema (Spirochaetes), was dominant in all termite species, except for T. riograndensis. Both in our own sequenced samples and in the broader comparison, prokaryotic alpha-diversity was higher in the soil/grass feeders than in the wood feeders. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity of prokaryotes and fungi was highly dissimilar among strict wood-feeders, whereas that of soil- and grass-feeders grouped more closely. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the only fungal phyla that could be identified in all gut samples, because of the lack of reference sequences in public databases. In summary, higher microbial diversity was recorded in termites with more versatile feeding sources, providing further evidence that diet, along with other factors (e.g., host taxonomy), influences the microbial community assembly in the termite gut.","2021-04-07","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-06-29 17:03:28","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-termite gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated associations of the GMC in stool with plasma LPS-binding protein (LBP, a measure of LPS) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in 110 premenopausal women in the United States. Diet was assessed using 3-day food records and GMCs were evaluated using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. OTUs were identified at 97% sequence similarity.

Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relation between LBP, specific bacterial genera identified with indicator species analysis, and CRP.

We enrolled 45 children with ASD (6-9 years of age; 39 boys and 6 girls) and 45 sex-and age-matched neurotypical children. Dietary and other socio-demographic information was obtained via questionnaires. We characterized the composition of the fecal microbiota using bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing. The ASD group showed less diversity and richness of gut microbiota than the neurotypical group, as estimated by the abundance-based coverage estimator index and the phylogenetic diversity index. The analysis of beta diversity showed an altered microbial community structure in the ASD group. After adjustment for confounders and multiple testing corrections, no significant group difference was found in the relative abundance of microbiota on the level of the phylum. At the family level, children with ASD had a lower relative abundance of Acidaminococcaceae than the healthy controls. Moreover, a decrease in the relative abundance of genera Lachnoclostridium, Tyzzerella subgroup 4, Flavonifractor, and unidentified Lachnospiraceae was observed in ASD group.

Dome-shaped naled ice bodies that had been forming and releasing subglacial water in the glacial forefield during accumulations season were used to study glacial microbiome. We tested the hypothesis that the properties of the water transported by these channels are site-dependent and influence bacterial diversity. We therefore established the phylogenetic structure of the subglacial microbial communities using next generation sequencing (NGS) of the 16S rRNA gene and performed bioinformatics analyses. A total of 1409 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) belonged to 40 phyla; mostly Proteobacteria, Gracilibacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Parcubacteria were identified. Sites located on the edge of Werenskioldbreen forefield (Angell, Kvisla) were mainly dominated by Betaproteobacteria. In the central site (Dusan) domination of Epsilonproteobacteria class was observed. Gracilibacteria (GN02) and Gammaproteobacteria represented the dominant taxa only in the sample Kvisla 2. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of beta diversity revealed that phylogenetic profiles grouped in three different clusters according to the sampling site. Moreover, higher similarity of bacterial communities from Angell and Kvisla compared to Dusan was confirmed by cluster analysis and Venn diagrams. The highest alpha index values was measured in Dusan. Richness and phylogenetic diversity indices were significantly (p < .05) and positively correlated with pH values of subglacial water and negatively with concentration of Cl-, Br-, and NO3- anions. These anions negatively impacted the values of richness indices but positively correlated with abundance of some microbial phyla. Our results indicated that subglacial water from naled ice bodies offer the possibility to study the glacial microbiome. In the studied subglacial water, the microbial community structure was sampling site specific and dependent on the water properties, which in turn were probably influenced by the local bedrock composition.

Moreover, different animal and human studies suggest that an overreactive immune system not only accompanies stress-associated disorders, but might even be causally involved in their pathogenesis. In support of this hypothesis, we recently showed that urban upbringing in the absence of daily contact with pets, compared to rural upbringing in the presence of daily contact with farm animals, is associated with a more pronounced immune activation following acute psychosocial stressor exposure induced by the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Here we employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to test whether this difference in TSST-induced immune activation between urban upbringing in the absence of daily contact with pets (n = 20) compared with rural upbringing in the presence of daily contact with farm animals (n = 20) is associated with differences in the composition of the salivary microbiome. Although we did not detect any differences in alpha or beta diversity measures of the salivary microbiome between the two experimental groups, statistical analysis revealed that the salivary microbial beta diversity was significantly higher in participants with absolutely no animal contact (n = 5, urban participants) until the age of 15 compared to all other participants (n = 35) reporting either daily contact with farm animals (n = 20, rural participants) or occasional pet contact (n = 15, urban participants). Interestingly, when comparing these urban participants with absolutely no pet contact to the remaining urban participants with occasional pet contact, the former also displayed a significantly higher immune, but not hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis or sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation, following TSST exposure. In summary, we conclude that only urban upbringing with absolutely no animal contact had long-lasting effects on the composition of the salivary microbiome and potentiates the negative consequences of urban upbringing on stress-induced immune activation.","2020-05-07","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-07-19 17:17:31","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human oral; var-built environment; var-geography; var-gut-brain axis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study provides a comprehensive culture-independent microbiome analysis from the sap of grapevine overtime and in a context of a vascular disease. The vascular system plays a key role by transporting nutrient, water and signals throughout the plant. The negative pressure in the xylem conduits, and low oxygen and nutrient content of its sap make it a unique and underexplored microbial environment. We hypothesized that grapevine hosts in its sap, microbes that have a beneficial impact on plant health by protecting against pathogen attack and supporting key biological processes. To address this hypothesis, we chose a vineyard under high Pierce's disease (PD). PD is caused by the xylem-dwelling pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. We selected ten grapevines within this vineyard with a range of disease phenotypes, and monitored them over 2 growing seasons. We sampled each vines at key phenological stages (bloom, veraison, and post-harvest) and used an amplicon metagenomics approach to profile the bacterial (16S-V4) and fungal (ITS) communities of the sap. We identified a core microbiome of the sap composed of seven bacterial (Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Massilia, Acinetobacter and Bacillus) and five fungal (Cladosporium, Mycosphaerella, Alternaria, Aureobasidium, and Filobasidium) taxa that were present throughout the growing season. Overall, the sap microbial makeup collected from canes was more similar to the root microbial profile. Alpha diversity metrics indicated a microbial enrichment at bloom and in vines with moderate PD severity suggesting a host-driven microbial response to environmental cues. Beta diversity metrics demonstrated that disease condition and plant phenology impacted microbial community profiles. Our study identified several potential taxonomic targets with antimicrobial and plant growth promoting capabilities that inhabit the grapevine sap and that should be further tested as potential biological control or biofertilizer agents.","2019-10-04","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-07-19 18:01:32","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-grapes; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During this period, reused litter may be decaked, tilled/windrowed, or treated with acid-based amendments to reduce ammonia and bacteria levels. Competitive exclusion, pH, and temperature are proposed factors that influence the level of pathogens and the overall litter microbiome during downtimes. We previously reported on the bacterial genetic factors associated with the fitness of two strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (SH) incubated for 14 d in reused litter. Here, we investigated the physicochemical parameters and the microbiome of the litter correlating with SH abundance during this period. We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to determine the litter microbiome and whole genome sequencing to characterize bacteria with competitive exclusion potential against SH. The beta diversity of the litter microbiome was significantly affected by the duration of incubation, microcosm, and microcosm plus Heidelberg strain combinations. In addition, beta diversity was significantly affected by litter parameters, including NH4, pH, moisture, water activity, and aluminum.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of FMT in treating children with RCDI, and explore fecal microbiota changes during FMT treatment. A total of 11 RCDI subjects with a median age of 3.5 years were enrolled in this single-center prospective pilot study. All patients were cured (11/11, 100%) by FMT either through upper gastrointestinal tract route with a nasointestinal tube (13/16, 81.2%) or lower gastrointestinal tract route with a rectal tube (3/16, 18.8%). The cure rate of single FMT was 63.6% (7/11), and 4 (4/11, 36.4%) cases were performed with 2 or 3 times of FMT. Mild adverse events were reported in 4 children (4/11, 36.4%), including transient diarrhea, mild abdominal pain, transient fever and vomit. Gut microbiota composition analysis of 59 fecal samples collected from 34 participants (9 RCDI children, 9 donors and 16 health controls) showed that the alpha diversity was lower in pediatric RCDI patients before FMT than the healthy controls and donors, and fecal microbial community of pre-FMT samples (beta diversity) was apart from that of healthy controls and donors. No significant differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity or phylogenetic distance were detected between donors and healthy controls. Both the richness and diversity of gut microbiota were improved in the pediatric RCDI patients after FMT, and the bacteria community was shifted closer to the donor and healthy control group. Furthermore, FMT re-directed gut microbiome functions of pediatric RCDI toward a health state. Our results indicate that it is safe and tolerant to use FMT in treating pediatric RCDI. FMT shifted the gut microbiome composition and function in children with RCDI toward a healthy state.","2018-11-02","2022-06-27 16:28:52","2022-06-30 20:40:23","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to unmask the bacterial diversity and most influential environmental parameters, Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA from 24 representative soil samples collected across south-east to north-west transect of the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi, China was conducted. This high-throughput sequencing revealed a total of 1,411,001 high quality sequences that classified into 38 phyla, 127 classes, >240 orders, and over 650 genera, suggesting a high bacterial richness across the Loess Plateau soils. The seven dominant groups were: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, and Verrucomicrobi (relative abundance of >5%). Increasing/ decreasing soil pH and geographic longitudinal distance correlated significantly with increasing/decreasing bacterial richness and diversity indices. Pairwise correlation analysis showed higher bacterial diversity at longitudinal gradients across 107 degrees 39'-109 degrees 15' (south-east to north-west) in our studied Chinese loess zone. Variation partitioning analysis indicated significant influence of soil characteristics (similar to 40.4%) than geographical distance (at a landscape scale of similar to 400 km) that was responsible for 13.6% of variation in bacterial community structure from these soils. Overall, contemporary soil characteristics structure the bacterial community in Loess Plateau soil to a greater extent than the spatial distances along the loess transect.","2018-10-18","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-06-27 16:28:53","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; beta diversity; biome-soil; var-longitudinal; var-pH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota independently contributes to each one of these risk factors, potentially mediated via gut microbial-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. In this study, we determined whether the gut microbiota were associated with HFpEF and its risk factors. Methods and Results We recruited 26 patients with HFpEF and 67 control participants from 2 independent communities. Patients with HFpEF were diagnosed by exercise right heart catheterization. We assessed the gut microbiome by bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and food intake by the food frequency questionnaire. There was a significant difference in alpha-diversity (eg, number of microbes) and beta-diversity (eg, type and abundance of microbes) between both cohorts of controls and patients with HFpEF (P=0.001). We did not find an association between beta-diversity and specific demographic or hemodynamic parameters or risk factors for HFpEF. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, a commonly used marker of gut dysbiosis, was lower, but not significantly so (P=0.093), in the patients with HFpEF. Compared with controls, the gut microbiome of patients with HFpEF was depleted of bacteria that are short-chain fatty acid producers. Consistent with this, participants with HFpEF consumed less dietary fiber (17.6 +/- 7.7 versus 23.2 +/- 8.8 g/day; P=0.016). Conclusions We demonstrate key changes in the gut microbiota in patients with HFpEF, including the depletion of bacteria that generate metabolites known to be important for cardiovascular homeostasis. Further studies are required to validate the role of these gut microbiota and metabolites in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.","2021-07-06","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-07-19 15:24:37","","","","13","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Community assembly processes occurring in these streams shape downstream population structure and nutrient cycles. To elucidate the development and stability of microbial communities along the length of a first- through third-order stream, fine-scale temporal and spatial sampling regimes were employed along Mc-Nutt Creek in Athens, GA, USA. 16S rRNA amplicon libraries were constructed from samples collected on a single day from 19 sites spanning the first 16.76 km of the stream. To provide context for this spatial study and evaluate temporal variability, selected sites at the stream's upper, mid, and lower reaches were sampled daily for 5 days preceding and following the spatial study. In a second study, three sites at and near the creek's headwaters were sampled daily for 11 days to understand initial bacterioplankton community assembly. Both studies revealed decreasing alpha and beta diversity with increasing downstream distance. These trends were accompanied by the enrichment of a small fraction of taxa found at low abundance in headwater-proximal sites. Similar sets of taxa consistently increased in relative abundance in downstream samples over time scales ranging from 1 day to 1 year, many of which belong to clades known to be abundant in freshwater environments. These results underpin the importance of headwaters as the site of rapid in-stream selection that results in the reproducible establishment of a highly stable community of freshwater riverine bacteria. IMPORTANCE Headwater streams are critical introduction points of microbial diversity for larger connecting rivers and play key roles in the establishment of taxa that partake in in-stream nutrient cycling. We examined the microbial community composition of a first- through third-order stream using fine-scale temporal and spatial regimes. Our results show that the bacterioplankton community develops rapidly and predictably from the headwater population with increasing total stream length. Along the length of the stream, the microbial community exhibits substantial diversity loss and enriches repeatedly for select taxa across days and years, although the relative abundances of individual taxa vary over time and space. This repeated enrichment of a stable stream community likely contributes to the stability and flexibility of downstream communities.","2019-06","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-06-30 17:03:18","","","","11","85","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent reports have highlighted the potential role of mucosal surface microbes in the pathogenesis of AMD. In this case-control study, the composition of the nasal and oral microbiota in newly diagnosed neovascular age-related macular degeneration cases (6 male, 7 female) was compared to controls without retinal diseases (2 male, 3 female). PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed with universal primers amplifying the V4 variable region (515F-806R). Distinct microbial community characterization was achieved using Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis index with comparative analysis between cases and controls performed within QIIME 2. Sequencing of all cases and controls revealed clear separation with strong beta diversity between oral and nasal microbial communities (p < 0.001). Microbial composition differed between cases and controls in both oral and nasal samples. The top three oral microbes identified as different compared to controls included Burkholderiales (7.41 log2fold change, p = 3.29E-05), Actinomyceataceae (6.22 log2fold change, p = 3.73E-06) and Gemella (5.28 log2fold change, p = 0.0002). The top three nasal microbes identified as different compared to controls included Rothia (13.6 log2fold change, p = 3.63E-18), Actinobacteria (10.29 log2fold change, p = 9.81E-10) and Propionibacteriales (8.73 log2fold change, p = 6.74E-09).

Methods This observational study was conducted in five health institutions. Over a 6-month study period, critically ill patients over 18 years old who were admitted to the intensive care unit were enrolled. Fecal microbiota profiles were determined from 155 individuals, over 60 years old (n = 72) and under 60 years old (n = 83). Gut microbiota was analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Alpha and beta diversity, operational taxonomic units and the interaction of gut microbiota with variables under study were analyzed. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) specifically associated with age were recovered by including gender, discharge condition, BMI, ICU stay and antibiotics as covariates in a linear mixed model. Results In older adults, sepsis, malnutrition, antibiotic prescription and severity (APACHE and SOFA scores) were higher than in the group under 60 years of age. Alpha diversity showed lower gut microbiota diversity in those over 60 years of age (p < 0.05); beta diversity evidenced significant differences between the groups (PERMANOVA = 1.19, p = 0.038). The microbiota of the adults under 60 years old showed greater abundance of Murdochiella, Megasphaera, Peptoniphilus and Ezakiella, whereas those over 60 years old Escherichia-Shigella and Hungatella were more abundant.

Although many studies have focused on the dynamics of the gut microbiota during development in captive animals, few studies have focused on the dynamics of the gut microbiota during development in wild animals, especially for the order Chiroptera. Methods: In this study, we characterized the gut microbiota of the wild Asian particolored bat (Vespertilio sinensis) from 1 day to 6 weeks after birth. We explored the changes in their gut microbial community compositions, examined possible influencing factors, and predicted the feeding transition period. Results: The gut microbiota changed during the development of V. sinensis. The alpha diversity of the bats' gut microbiota gradually increased but did not change significantly from the 1st day to the 4th week after birth; however, the alpha diversity decreased significantly in week 5, then stabilized. The beta diversity differed slightly in weeks 4-6. In week 4, the fecal samples showed the highest diversity in bacterial community composition. Thus, we predicted that the potential feeding transition period for V. sinensis may occur during week 4. Redundancy analysis showed that age and body mass index significantly affected the compositional changes of the gut microbiota in Asian particolored bats. Conclusion: The gut microbiota changed during the development of V. sinensis.

Therefore, the purpose of this observational study was to evaluate simultaneous longitudinal changes in the oral microbiome and cytokine production in the developing peri-implant sulcus compared to control natural teeth. Four and 12 weeks after implant placement and abutment connection, a dental implant and a natural tooth were sampled in 25 patients for subgingival plaque and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF [around teeth] and peri-implant crevicular fluid [PICF] around implants). DNA from plaque samples was extracted and sequenced using Illumina-based 16S rRNA sequencing. GCF and PICF samples were analyzed using a customized Milliplex human cytokine and chemokine magnetic bead panel. Beta diversity analysis revealed that natural teeth and implants had similar subgingival microbiomes, while teeth had greater alpha diversity than implants. At the genus level, however, few differences were noted between teeth and dental implants over 12 weeks. Specifically, Actinomyces and Selenomonas were significantly elevated around teeth versus dental implants at both 4 weeks and 12 weeks, while Corynebacterium and Campylobacter were significantly elevated only at 4 weeks around teeth. The only difference between PICF and GCF biomarkers was significantly elevated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels around teeth versus dental implants at the 4-week visit. The subgingival microbiome and cytokine production were similar between teeth and implants during early healing, suggesting that these profiles are driven by the patient following dental implant placement and are not determined by anatomical niche. IMPORTANCE Dental implants are a common treatment option offered to patients for tooth replacement. However, little is known regarding initial colonization of the subgingival microbiome and simultaneous longitudinal cytokine production in humans during the early healing phase following implant placement. We report findings from an in vivo study that assessed initial colonization of the subgingival microbiome and concomitant early cytokine production in a newly formed anatomical space, namely, an implant sulcus. This approach may be useful in future interventional studies to influence dental implant success. Our data showed that the subgingival microbiome and cytokine profile were similar for control natural teeth and dental implants at both 4 and 12 weeks after implant placement.

Soil microbial communities were assessed in wetland soils collected from pristine marsh, neighboring cropland (wetland turned into arable land), and land that had been reforested with Larix gmelinii. The alpha-diversities of bacteria, Acidobacteria, and fungi were affected by land-use change and were highest in the arable land and lowest in the wetland soils. The soil microbial community structures were also altered with changing land-use. Canonical correlation analyses showed that beta-diversity was significantly affected by soil pH, available phosphorus, soil nitrogen, and total organic carbon. Overall, our results showed that the agricultural cultivation of wetlands changes the available soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools, thereby influencing the bacterial, acidobacterial, and fungal diversity and community structure.

Insects are the most diverse group of animals which have established intricate evolutionary interactions with bacteria. However, the importance of these interactions is still poorly understood. Few studies have focused on a closely related group of insect species, to test the similarities and differences between their microbiota. Heliconius butterflies are a charismatic recent insect radiation that evolved the unique ability to use pollen as a protein source, which affected life history traits and resulted in an elevated speciation rates. We hypothesize that different Heliconius butterflies sharing a similar trophic pollen niche, harbor a similar gut flora within species, population and sexes. Methods. To test our hypothesis, we characterized the microbiota of 38 adult male and female butterflies representing six species of Heliconius butterflies and 2 populations of the same species. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene with the Roche 454 system and analyzed the data with standard tools for microbiome analysis. Results. Overall, we found a low microbial diversity with only 10 OTUs dominating across all individuals, mostly Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, which accounted for 99.5% of the bacterial reads. When rare reads were considered, we identified a total of 406 OTUs across our samples. We identified reads within Phyla Chlamydiae, found in 5 butterflies of four species. Interestingly, only three OTUs were shared among all 38 individuals (Bacillus, Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae). Altogether, the high individual variation overshadowed species and sex differences. Thus, bacterial communities were not structured randomly with 13% of beta-diversity explained by species, and 40 rare OTUs being significantly different across species. Finally, 13 OTUs, including the intercellular symbiont Spiroplasma, varied significantly in relative abundance between males and females. Discussion. The Heliconius microbial communities in these 38 individuals show a low diversity with few differences in the rare microbes between females, males, species or populations. Indeed, Heliconius butterflies, similarly to other insects, are dominated by few OTUs, mainly from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. The overall low microbial diversity observed contrasts with the high infra-species variation in microbiome composition. This could indicate that much of the microbiome maybe acquired from their surroundings. The significant differences between species and sexes were restricted to rare taxa, which could be important for microbial community stability under changing conditions as seen in other host-microbiome systems. The presence of symbionts like Spiroplasma or Chlamydiae, identified in this study for the first time in Heliconius, could play a vital role in their behavior and evolution by vertical transmission. Altogether, our study represents a step forward into the description of the microbial diversity in a charismatic group of closely related butterflies.","2018-10-02","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-06-30 19:42:31","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-insect gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We therefore designed an elevational gradient experiment to examine rhizosphere microbial (bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) diversity and composition using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS genes for comparison to plant and soil properties. Our results showed that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity was significantly higher at mid-elevation, while AMF alpha diversity decreased monotonically. The beta diversities of the three groups were significantly affected by elevational gradients, but the effect on bacterial beta diversity was larger than on fungal and AMF beta diversity.Proteobacteria, the dominant phyla of bacteria, was significantly higher at the mid-elevation, whileAcidobacteriaandActinobacteriasignificantly decreased as elevation increased. The main fungal taxa,Basidiomycota, significantly decreased with elevation, andAscomycotasignificantly increased with elevation.Glomeromycota, the dominant AMF phyla, responded insignificantly to the elevational gradients. The responses of bacterial and fungal alpha diversity were mostly associated with tree diversity and organic carbon, whereas AMF alpha diversity mainly depended on litter N and P. Changes in bacterial community composition along the elevational gradient were explained primarily by litter N and P, and litter P was the main driver of fungal and AMF community composition. Overall, our results suggest that plant litter, particularly litter N and P, were the main source of external carbon input and drove the observed differences in rhizosphere microbial diversity and community composition. Our results highlight the importance of litter nutrition in structuring rhizosphere microbial communities in mountain ecosystems.","2020-08-20","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-07-19 17:41:46","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-elevation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that the microbial alpha and beta diversity of supragingival microbiota significantly differed between ethnic groups. The supragingival plaque microbiota had the most complex microbial community in Burmese children. Within-group microbiota similarity in Burmese or Caucasian children was significantly higher than between-groups similarity. We identified seven ethnic group-specific bacterial taxa after adjusting for dental plaque index, decayed missing filled teeth (DMFT) and the frequency of brushing. Children with high plaque index and high DMFT values were more similar to each other in the overall microbial community, compared to low plaque index or low DMFT groups in which inter-subject variation is high.

To address this research gap, we examined the bacterial spatial turnover rate and the species networks in paired primary and secondary forest soils along a 3700-km north-south transect in eastern China using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The spatial turnover rate of bacterial communities was higher in primary forests than in secondary, suggesting deforestation increased biotic homogenization at a large geographic scale. Multiple regression on matrices analysis revealed that both geographic distance and soil properties (especially soil pH and organic matter availability) strongly affected bacterial spatial turnover. Through the phylogenetic molecular ecological network approach, we demonstrate that the bacterial network of primary forests was more intricate than in secondary forests. This suggests that microbial species have greater niche-sharing and more interactions in primary forests as compared to secondary forests. On the other hand, the bacterial network in secondary forests was more modular, and the taxa tended to co-occur, with positive correlations accounting for 82% of all potential interactions. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic deforestation has clear effects on bacterial spatial turnover and network interactions, with potential for serious consequences such as microbial diversity loss in primary forests.","2018-08","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-07-18 21:39:23","","80-86","","","123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene was performed with the NovaSeq PE250 platform to reveal the vaginal microbial community structure in healthy prepubertal girls and vulvovaginitis-associated microbiota. The intestinal microbiomes of healthy children were also analyzed for comparison. This study revealed that the healthy vaginal tract in prepubertal girls was dominated by Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Ezakiella, and Peptoniphilus species, with a high diversity of microbiota. The vulvovaginitis-associated microbiota were dominated by Streptococcus, Prevotella, Haemophilus, and Granulicatella, with lower diversity than that in healthy girls. Furthermore, the compositions of the vaginal and intestinal microbiomes were completely different. ANOSIM, MRPP, Adonis, and AMOVA were used to analyze the beta diversity, and the results showed that there were significant differences in the microbial communities among the three groups.

Methods Prospective patients with SSc from Lund University (LU), Sweden, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), United States, and control subjects provided stool specimens for 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity analyses were performed. Multivariate negative binomial models identified differentially abundant genera between groups. Results Patients from LU with SSc (n = 106) with recent SSc diagnosis (median disease duration 2.0 years) had lower abundance of commensal genera (eg, Faecalibacterium) and higher abundance of pathobiont genera (eg, Desulfovibrio) than LU-controls (n = 85).

Factors associated with beta diversity in patients with SSc from both LU and UCLA included disease duration (P = 0.0016), interstitial lung disease (P = 0.003), small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (P = 0.002), and immunosuppression use (P = 0.014). In multivariable analysis, the UCLA-SSc cohort had higher abundance of specific pathobiont genera (eg, Streptococcus) compared with the LU-SSc cohort. Conclusion Enrichments and depletions in certain microbial genera were observed in patients recently diagnosed with SSc, suggesting that dysbiosis is present in early SSc. Specific disease features were independently associated with fecal microbial composition in both cohorts. After controlling for these factors, the abundance of several pathobiont bacteria differed between the cohorts, suggesting that environmental factors, along with disease manifestations, should be considered in future SSc studies.","2022-05","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-06-30 17:00:49","","417-425","","5","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prenatal antibiotics have been associated with later obesity in children, which is thought to be driven by microbiome dependent mechanisms. However, there is little data regarding associations of prenatal or peripartum antibiotic exposure, with or without cesarean section (CS), with the features of the meconium microbiome. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on bacterial DNA of meconium samples from 105 infants in a birth cohort study. After multivariable adjustment, delivery mode (p = 0.044), prenatal antibiotic use (p = 0.005) and peripartum antibiotic use (p < 0.001) were associated with beta diversity of the infant meconium microbiome. CS (vs. vaginal delivery) and peripartum antibiotics were also associated with greater alpha diversity of the meconium microbiome (Shannon and Simpson, p < 0.05). Meconium from infants born by CS (vs. vaginal delivery) had lower relative abundance of the genus Escherichia (p < 0.001). Prenatal antibiotic use and peripartum antibiotic use (both in the overall analytic sample and when restricting to vaginally delivered infants) were associated with differential abundance of several bacterial taxa in the meconium. Bacterial taxa in the meconium microbiome were also differentially associated with infant excess weight at 12 months of age, however, sample size was limited for this comparison. In conclusion, prenatal and peripartum antibiotic use along with CS delivery were associated with differences in the diversity and composition of the meconium microbiome. Whether or not these differences in the meconium microbiome portend risk for long-term health outcomes warrants further exploration.","2020-02","2022-06-27 16:28:53","2022-07-19 17:11:23","","","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-antibiotics; var-birth mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design We amplified and sequenced the V1-V3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene extracted from intestinal tissue and corresponding fecal samples from 12 surgical patients with NEC and 14 surgical patients without NEC. Low quality and non-bacterial sequences were removed, and taxonomic assignment was made with the Ribosomal Database Project. Operational taxonomic units were clustered at 97%.

Additional analyses were performed to assess the contribution of other demographic and environmental confounding factors on the infant tissue and fecal microbiome. Results The fecal and tissue microbial communities were different. NEC was associated with a distinct microbiome, which was characterized by low diversity, higher abundances of Staphylococcus and Clostridium_sensu_stricto, and lower abundances of Actinomyces and Corynebacterium. Infant age and vancomycin exposure correlated with shifts in the tissue microbiome.

The geographic and temporal distributions of bacterial and fungal populations are poorly understood within the same wine grape cultivar. In this work, we describe the microbial composition from `Pinot noir' must with respect to vintage, growing region, climate, and must chemistry across the states of California and Oregon, USA. Materials and Methods. We sampled `Pinot noir' clone 667 dusters from 15 vineyards existing in a latitudinal gradient spanning nearly 1,200 km in California and Oregon for two vintages (2016 and 2017). Regions included five American Viticultural Areas (AVA). In order from southern California to Oregon, these AVAs were Santa Barbara, Monterey, Sonoma, Mendocino, and Willamette Valley. Uninoculated grape musts were subjected to 16S rRNA gene and ITS-1 amplicon sequencing to assess composition of microbial communities. We also measured grape maturity metrics. Finally, to describe regions by precipitation and growing degree days, we queried the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) spatial climate dataset. Results. Most of the dominant bacterial taxa in must samples were in the family Enterobacteriaceae, notably the lactic acid bacteria or the acetic acid bacteria groups, but some, like the betaproteobacterial genus Massilia, belonged to groups not commonly found in grape musts. Fungal communities were dominated by Hanseniaspora uvarum (Saccharomycetaceae). We detected relationships between covariates (e.g., vintage, precipitation during the growing season, pH, titratable acidity, and total soluble solids) and bacterial genera Gluconobacter and Tatumella in the family Enterobacteraceae, Sphingomonas (Sphingomonodaceae), Lactobacillus (Lactobacillaceae), and Massilia (Oxalobacteraceae), as well as fungal genera in Hanseniaspora, Kazachstania, Lachancea, Torulaspora in the family Saccharomycetaceae, as well as Alternaria (Pleosporaceae), Erysiphe (Erysiphaceae), and Udeniomyces (Cystofilobasidiaceae). Fungal community distances were significantly correlated with geographic distances, but this was not observed for bacterial communities. Climate varied across regions and vintages, with growing season precipitation ranging from 11 mm to 285 mm and growing degree days ranging from 1,245 to 1,846. Discussion. We determined that (1) bacterial beta diversity is structured by growing season precipitation, (2) fungal beta diversity reflects growing season precipitation and growing degree days, and (3) microbial differential abundances of specific genera vary with vintage, growing season precipitation, and fruit maturity metrics. Further, the correlation between fungal community dissimilarities and geographic distance suggests dispersal limitation and the vineyard as a source for abundant fungal taxa. Contrasting this observation, the lack of correlation between bacterial community dissimilarity and geographic distance suggests that environmental filtering is shaping these communities.","2021-02-04","2022-06-27 16:28:54","2022-07-19 15:22:09","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-grapes; var-environmental; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study describes vineyard microbial communities worldwide and establishes links between vineyard locations and microbial biodiversity on different scales: between continents, countries, and between different regions within the same country. Climate data correlates with fungal alpha diversity but not with prokaryotes alpha diversity, while spatial distance, on a global and national scale, is the main variable explaining beta-diversity in fungal and prokaryotes communities.

Notably, there was an increase in the relative abundance of the Enterobacteriaceae, with significant rises in its associated genera Escherichia, Candidatus blochmannia and Enterobacter in vitamin D deficient rats. Prevotella and Actinomyces were also increased and Odoribacteraceae and its genus Butyricimonas were decreased in rats with vitamin D-free diet. In conclusion, vitamin D deficit does not induce gut dysbiosis but produces some specific changes in bacterial taxa, which may play a pathophysiological role in the immunologic dysregulation associated with this hypovitaminosis.","2019-11","2022-06-27 16:28:54","2022-07-19 18:19:16","","","","11","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objectives were to investigate the effect of broad (BS) versus narrow (NS) spectrum antianaerobic antibiotic activity on lung microbiome diversity and pulmonary function, hypothesizing that BS antibiotics would cause greater change in microbiome diversity without a significant improvement in lung function. Methods: Pulmonary function tests and respiratory samples were collected prospectively in persons with CF before and after treatment for pulmonary exacerbations. Treatment antibiotics were classified as BS or NS. Gene sequencing data from 16S rRNA were used for diversity analysis and bacterial genera classification. We compared the effects of BS versus NS on diversity indices, lung function and anaerobic/aerobic ratios. Statistical significance was determined by multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear models and mixed-effects regression models. Results: Twenty patients, 6-20 years of age, experienced 30 exacerbations. BS therapy had a greater effect on beta diversity than NS therapy when comparing time points before antibiotics to after and at recovery. After antibiotics, the NS therapy group had a greater return toward baseline forced expiratory volume at 1 second and forced expiratory flow 25%-75% values than the BS group. The ratio of anaerobic/aerobic organisms showed a predominance of anaerobes in the NS group with aerobes dominating in the BS group. Conclusions: BS antianaerobic therapy had a greater and possibly longer lasting effect on the lung microbiome of persons with CF, without achieving the recovery of pulmonary function seen with the NS therapy. Specific antibiotic therapies may affect disease progression by changing the airway microbiome.","2021-11","2022-06-27 16:28:54","2022-07-19 17:52:33","","962-968","","11","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-antibiotics; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim was to identify changes in the bacterial composition of three individuals of reintroduced woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha) and the variables associated with such changes. Fecal samples were collected and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to determine gut microbial composition and functionality. Individual samples from released individuals showed a higher microbial diversity after being released compared to before liberation, associated with changes in their diet. Beta diversity and functionality analysis showed separation of samples from released and captive conditions and the major factor of variation was the moment of liberation. This study shows that intestinal microbiota varies depending on site conditions and is mainly associated with diet diversity. The intake of food from wild origin by released primates may promote a positive effect on gut microbiota, improving health, and potentially increasing success in reintroduction processes.","2021-03-22","2022-06-27 16:28:54","2022-06-30 17:02:56","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, for free ranging primates, little information is available for how microbiomes are influenced by ecological variation through time. Primates inhabiting seasonal tropical dry forests undergo seasonally specific decreases in food abundance and water availability, which have been linked to adverse health effects. Throughout the course of a seasonal transition in 2014, we collected fecal samples from three social groups of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys (Cebus capucinus imitator) in Sector Santa Rosa, Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. 16S rRNA sequencing data reveal that unlike other primates, the white-faced capuchin monkey gut is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Linear mixed effects models indicate that abundances of these genera are associated with fluctuating availability and consumption of fruit and arthropods, whereas beta diversity clusters by rainfall season. Whole shotgun metagenomics revealed that the capuchin gut is dominated by carbohydrate-binding modules associated with digestion of plant polysaccharides and chitin, matching seasonal dietary patterns. We conclude that rainfall and diet are associated with the diversity, composition, and function of the capuchin gut microbiome. Additionally, microbial fluctuations are likely contributing to nutrient uptake and the health of wild primate populations.","2019-01","2022-06-27 16:28:54","2022-06-30 17:47:26","","183-196","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; shotgun sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we investigated the relationship between hypertension prevalence and gut microbial composition in two cohorts. Methods: We included 871 unrelated TwinsUK women with faecal microbiome data (16s rRNA gene sequencing). Multivariable linear models adjusted for age, age(2) and BMI as well as MiRKAT models, were used to estimate the association of hypertension with alpha- and beta-diversity metrics. To identify taxa associated with hypertension, a generalized additive model for location scale and shape was computed adjusting for covariates and multiple testing. Results were replicated in 448 women from PREDICT-1. Results: We found that measures of alpha diversity are significantly lower in hypertensive cases [Beta(95% confidence interval, 95% CI) = -0.05 (-0.095 to -0.004), P = 0.03] and a significant association between beta diversity and hypertension (FDR< 0.05). We identified and replicated two genera associated with hypertension.

We genomically analysed the 16 s rRNA sequence and established a 100% identity match with the 16 s rRNA sequence of the genus Faecalibacillus. We functionally annotated Ruminiclostridium, identifying 83 metabolic pathways, including pathways previously linked to blood pressure regulation.

However, prevalence thresholds used to identify a common core are highly variable, and it remains unclear how they affect diversity estimates and whether insights stemming from core microbiomes are comparable across studies. We hypothesized that if macroecological patterns in gut microbiome prevalence and abundance are similar across host species, then we would expect that increasing prevalence thresholds would yield similar changes to alpha diversity and beta dissimilarity scores across host species datasets. We analyzed eight gut microbiome datasets based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and collected from different host species to (1) compare macroecological patterns across datasets, including amplicon sequence variant (ASV) detection rate with sequencing depth and sample size, occupancy-abundance curves, and rank-abundance curves; (2) test whether increasing prevalence thresholds generate universal or host-species specific effects on alpha and beta diversity scores; and (3) test whether diversity scores from prevalence-filtered core communities correlate with unfiltered data. We found that gut microbiomes collected from diverse hosts demonstrated similar ASV detection rates with sequencing depth, yet required different sample sizes to sufficiently capture rare ASVs across the host population. This suggests that sample size rather than sequencing depth tends to limit the ability of studies to detect rare ASVs across the host population. Despite differences in the distribution and detection of rare ASVs, microbiomes exhibited similar occupancy-abundance and rank-abundance curves. Consequently, increasing prevalence thresholds generated remarkably similar trends in standardized alpha diversity and beta dissimilarity across species datasets until high thresholds above 70%. At this point, diversity scores tended to become unpredictable for some diversity measures. Moreover, high prevalence thresholds tended to generate diversity scores that correlated poorly with the original unfiltered data. Overall, we recommend that high prevalence thresholds over 70% are avoided, and promote the use of diversity measures that account for phylogeny and abundance (Balance-weighted phylogenetic diversity and Weighted Unifrac for alpha and beta diversity, respectively), because we show that these measures are insensitive to prevalence filtering and therefore allow for the consistent comparison of core gut microbiomes across studies without the need for prevalence filtering.","2021-05-11","2022-06-27 16:28:54","2022-07-01 14:52:32","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, 16S rRNA sequencing method was used to illustrate the gut microbiota structure and commensal Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated to demonstrate their features. Results The results showed Epsilonbacteraeota (30%), Proteobacteria (25%), Firmicutes (19%), Fusobacteria (13%), and Bacteroidetes (8%) were the most abundant phyla in the gut of tree shrew. Campylobacteria, Campylobacterales, Helicobacteraceae and Helicobacter were the predominant abundance for class, order, family and genus levels respectively. The alpha diversity analysis showed statistical significance (P < 0.05) for operational taxonomic units (OTUs), the richness estimates, and diversity indices for age groups of tree shrew. Beta diversity revealed the significant difference (P < 0.05) between age groups, which showed high abundance of Epsilonbacteraeota and Spirochaetes in infant group, Proteobacteria in young group, Fusobacteria in middle group, and Firmicutes in senile group.

The most isolated commensal Enterobacteriaceae bacteria from tree shrew were Proteus spp. (67%) and Escherichia coli (25%). Among these strains, the antibiotic resistant isolates were commonly found, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results of Proteus spp. indicated a high degree of similarity between isolates in the same age group, which was not observed for other bacteria.

To investigate the use of soil microbial community to inform criminal investigation, this study was designed to mimic clandestine graves. It compared the decomposition of stillborn piglets (Sus scrofa domesticus), as human analogues, to oak (Quercus robur) leaf litter and soil-only controls outdoors for 720 days. Environmental and edaphic parameters were monitored and showed soil microbial community alignment with temperature seasonality, which highlighted the importance of this abiotic factor. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) data were used to calculate Hill numbers and diversity indices of the bacterial 16S rRNA community did not distinguish mammalian- from plant-based decomposition consistently during the first or second year of the study. In contrast, the fungal 18S rRNA community allowed clear differentiation between different treatments (beta diversity) throughout the 720-day experiment and suggested the moment of the decomposing mammalian skin rupture. 16S rRNA-based NGS facilitated the identification of e.g., Pirellulaceae, Acidobacteria ii1-15_order and Candidatus xiphinematobacter as Year 2 bacterial markers of gravesoil at family, order and species taxonomic levels, respectively, and confirmed the similarity of the calculated Hill diversity metrics with those derived from DGGE profiling. Parallel soil elemental composition was measured by portable X-ray Fluorescence where calcium profiles for the piglet-associated soils were distinct from those without carrion. Also, soil calcium content and PMI correlated positively during the first year then negatively during the second. This study is one of the first to apply a multidisciplinary approach based on molecular and physicochemical analytical techniques to assess decomposition. It highlights the recognised potential of using soil microbial community in forensic investigations and provides a proof-of-concept for the application of a combined molecular and elemental approach to further understand the dynamics of decomposition. In addition, it sets the scene for further research in different conditions based on Hill numbers metrics instead of the classic ecological indices for soil necrobiome richness, diversity and evenness.","2021-05-13","2022-06-27 16:28:55","2022-06-30 16:47:29","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies examining host-associated microbiomes of these species have been limited in geographic region, life stage, and/or health. Here, we characterized the microbiome of the oral cavity and cloaca from wild-captured Kemp's ridley and green turtles off the west coast of Florida, USA, by using Illumina sequencing to analyze the 16S rRNA gene. Microbial communities were distinct between body sites as well as between turtle species, suggesting that the turtle species is more important than the local environment in determining the microbiome of sea turtles. We identified the core microbiome for each species at each body site and determined that there were very few bacteria shared among the oral samples of both species, and no taxa co-occurred in the cloaca samples among both species. The core microbiome of the green turtle cloaca was primarily from the order Clostridiales, which plays an important role in digestion for other herbivorous species. Due to high prevalence of fibropapillomatosis in the green turtles (90%), we also investigated the correlation between the microbiome and the severity of fibropapillomatosis, and we identified changes in beta diversity associated with the total number of tumors.

Methods Saliva samples were obtained from 846 females and 368 males aged 35-69 years from a Canadian population cohort, the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (PATH). Samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and differences in microbial community compositions between nonusers, single-, and multi-drug users as well as the 3 most commonly used medications (thyroid hormones, statins, and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) were examined. Results Twenty-six percent of participants were taking 1 medication and 21% were reported taking 2 or more medications. Alpha diversity indices of Shannon diversity, Evenness, Richness, and Faith's phylogenetic diversity were similar among groups, likewise beta diversity as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (R-2 = 0.0029, P = 0.053) and weighted UniFrac distances (R-2 = 0.0028, P = 0.161) were non-significant although close to our alpha value threshold (P = 0.05). After controlling for covariates (sex, age, BMI), six genera (Saprospiraceae uncultured, Bacillus, Johnsonella, Actinobacillus, Stenotrophomonas, and Mycoplasma) were significantly different from non-medication users. Thyroid hormones, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and PPI were the most reported medications. Shannon diversity differed significantly among those taking no medication and those taking only thyroid hormones, however, there were no significant difference in other measures of alpha- or beta diversity with single thyroid hormone, statin, or PPI use. Compared to participants taking no medications, the relative abundance of eight genera differed significantly in participants taking thyroid hormones, six genera differed in participants taking statins, and no significant differences were observed with participants taking PPI. Conclusion The results from this study show negligible effect of commonly used medications on microbial diversity and small differences in the relative abundance of specific taxa, suggesting a minimal influence of commonly used medication on the salivary microbiome of individuals living without major chronic conditions.","2021-12-09","2022-06-27 16:28:55","2022-06-30 17:02:20","","","","12","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed the first in-depth survey of the microbiota associated with four free-living populations of Caribbean sea urchins: Lytechinus variegatus, Echinometra lucunter, Tripneustes ventricosus, and Diadema antillarum. We compared the influence of the collection site, echinoid species and trophic niche to the composition of the microbiota. This dataset provides a comprehensive overview to date, of the bacterial communities and their ecological relevance associated with sea urchins in their natural environments. A total of sixtysamples, including surrounding reef water and seagrass leaves underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region) and high-quality reads were analyzed with standard bioinformatic approaches. While water and seagrass were dominated by Cyanobacteria such as Prochlorococcus and Rivularia respectively, echinoid gut samples had dominant Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. Propionigenium was dominant across all species' guts, revealing a host-associated composition likely responsive to the digestive process of the animals. Beta-diversity analyses showed significant differences in community composition among the three collection sites, animal species, and trophic niches. Alpha diversity was significantly higher among L. variegatus samples compared to the other species. L. variegatus also displayed an increased abundance of Planctomycetes and Cyanobacterial OTUs. The bacterial community of this herbivorous echinoid reflected similarities to the microfilm community found on Thalassia testudinum leaves; a very abundant seagrass and its main food resource. The results of this study elaborate on the microbial ecology of four important Caribbean echinoids, confirming that selection on the microbial community is trophic-niche dependent.","2021-08-31","2022-06-27 16:28:55","2022-07-19 18:23:17","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-sea urchin; var-environmental; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The amphibian skin microbiome is recognized for its role in defence against pathogens, including the deadly fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Yet, we have little understanding of evolutionary and ecological processes that structure these communities, especially for salamanders and closely related species. We investigated patterns in the distribution of bacterial communities on Plethodon salamander skin across host species and environments. 2. Quantifying salamander skin microbiome structure contributes to our understanding of how host-associated bacteria are distributed across the landscape, among host species, and their putative relationship with disease. 3. We characterized skin microbiome structure (alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and bacterial operational taxonomic unit [OTU] abundances) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing for co-occurring Plethodon salamander species (35 Plethodon cinereus, 17 Plethodon glutinosus, 10 Plethodon cylindraceus) at three localities to differentiate the effects of host species from environmental factors on the microbiome. We sampled the microbiome of P. cinereus along an elevational gradient (n = 50, 700-1,000 ma.s.l.) at one locality to determine whether elevation predicts microbiome structure. Finally, we quantified prevalence and abundance of putatively anti-Bd bacteria to determine if Bd-inhibitory bacteria are dominant microbiome members. 4. Co-occurring salamanders had similar microbiome structure, but among sites salamanders had dissimilar microbiome structure for beta-diversity and abundance of 28 bacterial OTUs. We found that alpha-diversity increased with elevation, beta-diversity and the abundance of 17 bacterial OTUs changed with elevation (16 OTUs decreasing, 1 OTU increasing). We detected 11 putatively anti-Bd bacterial OTUs that were present on 90% of salamanders and made up an average relative abundance of 83% (SD +/- 8.5) per salamander. All salamanders tested negative for Bd. 5. We conclude that environment is more influential in shaping skin microbiome structure than host differences in these congeneric species, and suggest that environmental characteristics that covary with elevation influence microbiome structure. High prevalence and abundance of anti-Bd bacteria may contribute to low Bd levels in these populations of Plethodon salamanders.","2018-03","2022-06-27 16:28:55","2022-06-30 18:36:05","","341-353","","2","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-amphibian skin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we characterized simultaneously the oral bacterial and fungal microbiomes in a large cohort of systemically healthy Chinese adults by sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer. We showed that different factors shaped the oral bacterial and fungal microbiomes in healthy adults. Sex and age were associated with the alpha diversity of the healthy oral bacterial microbiome but not that of the fungal microbiome. Age was also a major factor affecting the beta diversity of the oral bacterial microbiome; however, it only exerted a small effect on the oral fungal microbiome when compared with other variables. After controlling for age and sex, the bacterial microbiota structure was most affected by marital status, recent oral conditions and oral hygiene-related factors, whereas the fungal microbiota structure was most affected by education level, fruits and vegetables, and bleeding gums. Bacterial-fungal interactions were limited in the healthy oral microbiota, with the strongest association existing between Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodotorula dairenensis. Several bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to Veillonella atypica and the genera Leptotrichia, Streptococcus and Prevotella_7 and fungal ASVs belonging to Candida albicans and the genus Blumeria were revealed as putative pivotal members of the healthy oral microbiota. Overall, our study has facilitated understanding of the determining factors and cross-kingdom interactions of the healthy human oral microbiome.

The transport and storage of samples in temperatures of minus 80 degrees C is commonly considered as the gold standard for microbiome studies.

Methods. In this study we compare alpha diversity and 16S microbiome composition of 20 fecal sample replicates from Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) preserved in a minus 80 degrees C freezer and transported on dry ice to freeze-dried samples that were stored and transported in ambient temperature until DNA extraction. Results. We found strong correlations between relative abundances of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) between preservation treatments of the sample, no differences in alpha diversity measures between the two preservation treatments and minor effects of the preservation treatment on beta diversity measures.

Methods Fifty-nine patients with JIA (mean age, 12.6 +/- 2.7 years) and 34 healthy controls (HC; mean age 12.3 +/- 3.0 years) were consecutively recruited in this Norwegian cross-sectional study. Information about demographics, disease activity, medication history, frequency of tooth brushing and a modified version of the gingival bleeding index (GBI) and the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S) was obtained. Microbiome profiling of saliva samples was performed by sequencing of the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, coupled with a species-level taxonomy assignment algorithm; QIIME, LEfSe and R-package for Spearman correlation matrix were used for downstream analysis. Results There were no significant differences between JIA and HC in alpha- and beta-diversity. However, differential abundance analysis revealed several taxa to be associated with JIA: TM7-G1, Solobacterium and Mogibacterium at the genus level; and Leptotrichia oral taxon 417, TM7-G1 oral taxon 352 and Capnocytophaga oral taxon 864 among others, at the species level.

By Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing, we monitored soil bacteria in 360 stations on a 100 square meter plot distributed across six intra-annual samplings in a rarely managed, temperate grassland. Using a multi-tiered approach, we tested the extent to which stochastic or deterministic processes influenced the composition of local communities. A combination of phylogenetic turnover analysis and null modeling demonstrated that either homogenization by unlimited stochastic dispersal or scenarios, in which neither stochastic processes nor deterministic forces dominated, explained local assembly processes. Thus, the majority of all sampled communities (82%) was rather homogeneous with no significant changes in abundance-weighted composition. However, we detected strong and uniform taxonomic shifts within just nine samples in early summer. Thus, community snapshots sampled from single points in time or space do not necessarily reflect a representative community state. The potential for change despite the overall homogeneity was further demonstrated when the focus shifted to the rare biosphere. Rare OTU turnover, rather than nestedness, characterized abundance-independent beta-diversity. Accordingly, boosted generalized additive models encompassing spatial, temporal and environmental variables revealed strong and highly diverse effects of space on OTU abundance, even within the same genus. This pure spatial effect increased with decreasing OTU abundance and frequency, whereas soil moisture - the most important environmental variable - had an opposite effect by impacting abundant OTUs more than the rare ones. These results indicate that - despite considerable oscillation in space and time - the abundant and resident OTUs provide a community backbone that supports much higher b-diversity of a dynamic rare biosphere. Our findings reveal complex interactions among space, time, and environmental filters within bacterial communities in a long-established temperate grassland.","2020-06-30","2022-06-27 16:28:56","2022-07-19 19:49:18","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-longitudinal; var-spatial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the effects of a 4-week isocaloric and macronutrient-matched diet low or high in AGEs on the gut microbial composition of 70 abdominally obese individuals in a double-blind parallel-design randomized controlled trial (NCT03866343). Additionally, we investigated the cross-sectional associations between the habitual intake of dietary dicarbonyls, reactive precursors to AGEs, and the gut microbial composition, as assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon-based sequencing. Despite a marked percentage difference in AGE intake, we observed no differences in microbial richness and the general community structure. Only the Anaerostipes spp. had a relative abundance >0.5% and showed differential abundance (0.5 versus 1.11%; p = 0.028, after low- or high-AGE diet, respectively). While the habitual intake of dicarbonyls was not associated with microbial richness or a general community structure, the intake of 3-deoxyglucosone was especially associated with an abundance of several genera. Thus, a 4-week diet low or high in AGEs has a limited impact on the gut microbial composition of abdominally obese humans, paralleling its previously observed limited biological consequences. The effects of dietary dicarbonyls on the gut microbiota composition deserve further investigation.","2022-05","2022-06-27 16:28:56","2022-07-19 14:53:22","","","","10","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We surveyed workers in or near the park with elevated exposure to macaques to characterize tasks resulting in exposure to macaque feces in addition to dietary and lifestyle factors that influence gut microbiome composition. Fecal samples were collected from 12 exposed workers and 6 controls without macaque exposure, as well as 8 macaques from Kosumpee Forest Park and 4 from an isolated forest patch with minimal human contact. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene from fecal sample extracted DNA was amplified and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq to characterize the microbial community. A permuted betadisper test on the weighted UniFrac distances revealed significant differences in the dispersion patterns of gut microbiota from exposed and control macaques (p = 0.03). The high variance in gut microbiota composition of macaques in contact with humans has potential implications for gut microbiome stability and susceptibility to disease, described by the Anna Karenina principle (AKP). Human samples had homogenous variance in beta diversity but different spatial medians between groups (p = 0.02), indicating a shift in microbial composition that may be explained by fundamental lifestyle differences between the groups unrelated to exposure status. SourceTracker was used to estimate the percent of gut taxa in exposed humans that was contributed by macaques. While one worker showed evidence of elevated contribution, the overall trend was not significant. Task observations among workers revealed opportunities to employ protective measures or training to reduce exposure to occupational hazards.

We have compared the microbiota identified by repeated bronchoscopy in healthy subjects and patients with ostructive lung diseaseases (OLD). Methods 21 healthy controls and 41 patients with OLD completed two bronchoscopies. In addition to negative controls (NCS) and oral wash (OW) samples, we gathered protected bronchoalveolar lavage in two fractions (PBAL1 and PBAL2) and protected specimen brushes (PSB). After DNA extraction, we amplified the V3V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and performed paired-end sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Initial bioinformatic processing was carried out in the QIIME-2 pipeline, identifying amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with the DADA2 algorithm. Potentially contaminating ASVs were identified and removed using the decontam package in R and the sequenced NCS. Results A final table of 551 ASVs consisted of 19 x 10(6) sequences. Alpha diversity was lower in the second exam for OW samples, and borderline lower for PBAL1, with larger differences in subjects not having received intercurrent antibiotics. Permutational tests of beta diversity indicated that within-individual changes were significantly lower than between-individual changes. A non-parametric trend test showed that differences in composition between the two exams (beta diversity) were largest in the PSBs, and that these differences followed a pattern of PSB > PBAL2 > PBAL1 > OW. Time between procedures was not associated with increased diversity. Conclusion The airways microbiota varied between examinations. However, there is compositional microbiota stability within a person, beyond that of chance, supporting the notion of a transient airways microbiota with a possibly more stable individual core microbiome.","2021-11-02","2022-06-27 16:28:56","2022-06-29 17:13:26","","","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, spatio-temporal research into subsoil microbial diversity and the effects of agricultural management remains limited. Soil type may influence subsoil microbial diversity, particularly Vertosols. These soils lack distinct horizons and are known to facilitate the downward movement of organic matter, potentially supporting subsoil microbiota, removed from the crop root system (i.e., bulk soils). Our research used the MiSeq Illumina Platform to investigate microbial diversity down the profile of an agricultural Australian Vertosol to 1.0 m in bulk soils, as influenced by crop system (continuous cotton and cotton-maize) and sample time (pre- and in-crop samples collected over two seasons). Overall, both alpha- (Chao1, Gini-Simpson Diversity and Evenness indices) and beta-diversity (nMDS and Sorensen's Index of Similarity) metrics indicated that both bacterial (16S) diversity and fungal (ITS) diversity decreased with increasing soil depth. The addition of a maize rotation did not significantly influence alpha-diversity metrics until 0.70-1.0 m depth in the soil, where bacterial diversity was significantly higher in this system, with beta-diversity measures indicating this is likely due to root system differences influencing dissolved organic carbon. Sample time did not significantly affect bacterial or fungal diversity over the two seasons, regardless of the crop type and status (i.e., crop in ground and post crop). The relatively stable subsoil fungal and overall microbial diversity in bulk soils over two crop seasons suggests that these microbiota have developed a tolerance to prolonged agricultural management.","2020-09","2022-06-27 16:28:56","2022-07-19 19:57:16","","","","3","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-plant; biome-soil; dist-Sorensen's Index; fungi sequencing; ordin-NMDS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study of local communities along a regional metacommunity can reveal patterns of community assembly, and disentangle the underlying ecological processes. In particular, we seek drivers of community assembly at the regional scale using a large lacustrine dataset (>300 lakes) along the geographical, limnological and physico-chemical gradients in the Pyrenees. By using high throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, and inferring environmental sources of bacterial immigrants, we showed that surface aquatic bacterial assemblages were strongly influenced by terrestrial populations from soil, biofilms or sediments, and primarily selected by a pH-alkalinity gradient. Indeed, source proportions explained 27% of the community variation, and chemistry 15% of the total variation, half of it shared with the sources. Major taxonomic groups such as Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes showed higher aquatic affinities than Parcubacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria or Betaproteobacteria, which may be recruited and selected through different hydrographic habitats. A regional fingerprint was observed with lower alpha diversity and higher beta diversity in the central Pyrenees than in both ends. We suggest an ecological succession process, likely influenced by complex interactions of environmental source dispersal and environmental filtering along the mountain range geography.","2020-01","2022-06-27 16:28:56","2022-06-30 17:03:20","","297-309","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adult male and female NOD mice were fed with either soy-based or casein-based diet, and received GEN at 20 mg/kg body weight by gavage daily. The BGL and immune responses (represented by serum antibodies, cytokines and chemoldnes, and histopathology) were monitored, while the fecal gut microbiome was sequenced for 16S ribosomal RNA to reveal any alterations in gut microbial communities. A significantly reduced BGL was found in NOD males fed with soy-based diet on day 98 after initial dosing, and an improved glucose tolerance was observed on both diets. In addition, an anti-inflammatory response (suggested by reduced IgG(2b) and cytokine/chemokine levels, and alterations in the microbial taxonomy) was accompanied by an altered (beta-diversity in gut microbial species. Among the NOD females exposed to GEN, a later onset of T1D was observed. However, the profiles of gut microbiome, antibodies and cytokines/chemokines were all indicative of pro-inflammation. This study demonstrated an association among GEN exposure, gut microbiome alteration, and immune homeostasis in NOD males. Although the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of GEN in NOD mice need to be explored further, the current study suggested a GEN-induced sex-specific effect in inflammatory status and gut microbiome.

There is increasing interest in the roles of bacterial extracellular vesicles (EVs) in various diseases. We studied the composition and function of microbiota-derived EVs in the plasma of patients receiving mechanical ventilation to evaluate whether they can be used as a diagnostic marker and to predict clinical outcomes. Methods: Plasma samples (n = 111) from 59 mechanically ventilated patients (41 in the pneumonia group; 24 in the nursing home and hospital-associated infection [NHAI] group) were prospectively collected on days one and seven. After isolating the bacterial EVs from plasma samples, nucleic acid was extracted for 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The samples were evaluated to determine the alpha and beta diversity, bacterial composition, and predicted functions. Results: Principal coordinates analysis revealed significantly different clustering of microbial EVs between the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups. The proportions of Lactobacillus, Cutibacterium, and Sphingomonas were significantly different between the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups. In addition, the abundances of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly higher in the non-NHAI than the NHAI group. In the analysis of beta diversity, the structure of microbial EVs differed significantly different between 28-day survivors and non-survivors (Bray-Curtis distance, p = 0.014). Functional profiling revealed significant differences between the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups. The longitudinal change in predicted functions of microbial EV genes showed a significant difference between 28-day survivors and non-survivors.

Hence, we conducted a temporal field study by sampling rock pools in four-day intervals during a 5-week period that included strong changes in environmental conditions due to intensive rain. We characterized bacterial and microeukaryote communities by 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Using a suite of null model approaches (elements of metacommunity structure, Raup-Crick beta-diversity and quantitative process estimates) to assess dynamics in community assembly, we found that strong changes in environmental conditions induced small but significant temporal changes in assembly processes and triggered different responses in bacterial and microeukaryotic metacommunities, promoting distinct selection processes. Incidence-based approaches showed that the assemblies of both communities were mainly governed by stochastic processes. In contrast, abundance-based methods indicated the dominance of historical contingency and unmeasured factors in the case of bacteria and microeukaryotes, respectively. We distinguished these processes from dispersal-related processes using additional tests. Regardless of the applied null model, our study highlights that community assembly processes are not static, and the relative importance of different assembly processes can vary under different conditions and between different microbial groups.","2020-02-12","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-06-30 17:08:40","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we use a microbial ecology and network framework to understand the dynamics of interactions/co-occurrences of bacteria in the bladder and vagina in women with and without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). MethodsWe collected vaginal swabs and catheterized urine specimens from 20 women with UUI (cases) and 30 women without UUI (controls). We sequenced the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and evaluated using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We used microbial network analysis to detect interactions in the microbiome and the betweenness centrality measure to identify central bacteria in the microbial network. Bacteria exhibiting maximum betweenness centrality are considered central to the microbe-wide networks and likely maintain the overall microbial network structure. ResultsThere were no significant differences in the vaginal or bladder microbiomes between cases and controls using alpha and beta diversity. Silhouette metric analysis identified two distinct microbiome clusters in both the bladder and vagina. One cluster was dominated by Lactobacillus genus while the other was more diverse. Network-based analyses demonstrated that vaginal and bladder microbial networks were different between cases and controls. In the vagina, there were similar numbers of genera and subgroup clusters in each network for cases and controls. However, cases tend to have more unique bacterial co-occurrences. While Bacteroides and Lactobacillus were the central bacteria with the highest betweenness centrality in controls, Aerococcus had the highest centrality in cases and correlated with bacteria commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis. In the bladder, cases have less than half as many network clusters compared to controls. Lactobacillus was the central bacteria in both groups but associated with several known uropathogens in cases. The number of shared bacterial genera between the bladder and the vagina differed between cases and controls, with cases having larger overlap (43%) compared to controls (29%). ConclusionOur study shows overlaps in microbial communities of bladder and vagina, with higher overlap in cases. We also identified differences in the bacteria that are central to the overall community structure.","2022-03-24","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-07-19 19:54:56","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human urine; biome-human vagina; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we compare the diversity and temporal dynamics of microbiotas directly sampled from the trachea via tracheostomy in patients with (YLRI) and without (NLRI) lower respiratory infections. Methods We prospectively collected 127 tracheal aspirates across four consecutive meteorological seasons (quarters) from 40 patients, of whom 20 developed LRIs and 20 remained healthy. All aspirates were collected when patients had no LRI. We generated 16S rRNA-based microbial profiles (similar to 250 bp) in a MiSeq platform and analyzed them using Mothur and the SILVAv123 database. Differences in microbial diversity and taxon normalized (via negative binomial distribution) abundances were assessed using linear mixed effects models and multivariate analysis of variance. Results and discussion Alpha-diversity (ACE, Fisher and phylogenetic diversity) and beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard and Unifrac distances) indices varied significantly (P<0.05) between NLRI and YLRI microbiotas from tracheostomised patients. Additionally, Haemophilus was significantly (P = 0.009) more abundant in YLRI patients than in NLRI patients, while Acinetobacter, Corynebacterium and Pseudomonas (P<0.05) showed the inverse relationship. We did not detect significant differences in diversity and bacterial abundance among seasons. This result disagrees with previous evidence suggesting seasonal variation in airway microbiotas.

Here, we investigated the influence of several well-known ecological principles on animal-associated microbiota by characterizing gut microbial specimens from bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilateria) ranging from flies to whales. A rigorously vetted sample set containing 265 specimens from 64 species was assembled. Bacterial lineages were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Previously published samples were also compared, allowing analysis of over 1,098 samples in total. A restricted number of bacterial phyla was found to account for the great majority of gut colonists. Gut microbial composition was associated with host phylogeny and diet. We identified numerous gut bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences that diverged deeply from previously studied taxa,identifying opportunities to discover new bacterial types. The number of bacterial lineages per gut sample was positively associated with animal mass, paralleling known species-area relationships from island biogeography and implicating body size as a determinant of community stability and niche complexity. Samples from larger animals harbored greater numbers of anaerobic communities, specifying a mechanism for generating more-complex microbial environments. Predictions for species/abundance relationships from models of neutral colonization did not match the data set, pointing to alternative mechanisms such as selection of specific colonists by environmental niche. Taken together, the data suggest that niche complexity increases with gut size and that niche selection forces dominate gut community construction. IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiome of animals is essential for health, contributing to digestion of foods, proper immune development, inhibition of pathogen colonization, and catabolism of xenobiotic compounds. How these communities assemble and persist is just beginning to be investigated. Here we interrogated a set of gut samples from a wide range of animals to investigate the roles of selection and random processes in microbial community construction. We show that the numbers of bacterial species increased with the weight of host organisms, paralleling findings from studies of island biogeography. Communities in larger organisms tended to be more anaerobic, suggesting one mechanism for niche diversification. Nonselective processes enable specific predictions for community structure, but our samples did not match the predictions of the neutral model. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of niche selection in community construction and suggest mechanisms of niche diversification.","2018-04","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-07-19 17:47:35","","","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-animal microbiomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Summit samples showed consistency in microbial community composition. However, beta-diversity increased markedly in communities from downslope cores, which were dominated by methyl- and methanotrophic genera of Gammaproteobacteria.

Several studies suggested that different plants types and even genotypes of the same plant species harbor partially different microbiomes. Here, we characterize the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiota across five grapevine rootstock genotypes cultivated in the same soil at two vineyards and sampling dates over 2 years by 16S rRNA gene and ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing. In addition, we use quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach to measure the relative abundance and dynamic changes of fungal pathogens associated with black-foot disease. The objectives were to (1) unravel the effects of rootstock genotype on microbial communities in the rhizosphere of grapevine and (2) to compare the relative abundances of sequence reads and DNA amount of black-foot disease pathogens. Host genetic control of the microbiome was evident in the rhizosphere of the mature vineyard. Microbiome composition also shifted as year of sampling, and fungal diversity varied with sampling moments. Linear discriminant analysis identified specific bacterial (i.e., Bacillus) and fungal (i.e., Glomus) taxa associated with grapevine rootstocks. Host genotype did not predict any summary metrics of rhizosphere alpha- and beta-diversity in the young vineyard. Regarding black-foot associated pathogens, a significant correlation between sequencing reads and qPCR was observed. In conclusion, grapevine rootstock genotypes in the mature vineyard were associated with different rhizosphere microbiomes. The latter could also have been affected by age of the vineyard, soil properties or field management practices. A more comprehensive study is needed to decipher the cause of the rootstock microbiome selection and the mechanisms by which grapevines are able to shape their associated microbial community. Understanding the vast diversity of bacteria and fungi in the rhizosphere and the interactions between microbiota and grapevine will facilitate the development of future strategies for grapevine protection.","2019-05-22","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-06-30 19:29:58","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-root; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, nearly all these studies were conducted in rodents fed with a diet that does not approximate what is typically consumed by humans. To address this, mice were fed a Total Western Diet (TWD) based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data that mimics the macro and micronutrient composition of a typical American diet for 6 weeks and then supplemented with 0, 2, 5, or 10% of the RS2, resistant potato starch (RPS), for an additional 3 weeks. The cecal microbiome was analyzed by 16S sequencing. The alpha-diversity of the microbiome decreased with increasing consumption of RPS while a beta-diversity plot showed four discreet groupings based on the RPS level in the diet. The relative abundance of various genera was altered by feeding increasing levels of RPS. In particular, the genus Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group was markedly increased. Cecal, proximal, and distal colon tissue mRNA abundance was analyzed by RNASeq. The cecal mRNA abundance principal component analysis showed clear segregation of the four dietary groups whose separation decreased in the proximal and distal colon. Differential expression of the genes was highest in the cecum, but substantially decreased in the proximal colon (PC) and distal colon (DC). Most differentially expressed genes were unique to each tissue with little overlap in between. The pattern of the observed gene expression suggests that RPS, likely through metabolic changes secondary to differences in microbial composition, appears to prime the host to respond to a range of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. In summary, consumption of dietary RPS led to significant changes to the microbiome and gene expression in the cecum and to a lesser extent in the proximal and distal colon.","2022-03-22","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-06-30 20:21:06","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results show that each host species shows microbiome compositional specificity, even across PtC, and that alpha diversity does not change significantly across this boundary for any of the gastropod hosts. However, for two of the host species, beta diversity differs significantly across PtC, indicating that there may be multiple levels of organization of the marine gastropod microbiome.

Untargeted stool metabolites were analyzed (HPLC/MS) and expressed as the fold-change between group means (control to MFGM+LF ratio). Results: Alpha diversity increased significantly in both groups from baseline to 4 mo. Subtle group differences in beta diversity were demonstrated at 4 mo (Jaccard distance; R-2 = 0.01, P = 0.042). Specifically, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides plebeius were more abundant in the MFGM+LF group at 4 mo. Metabolite profile differences for MFGM+LF versus control included lower fecal medium-chain fatty acids, deoxycamitine, and glycochenodeoxycholate, and some higher fecal carbohydrates and steroids (P < 0.05). After applying multiple test correction, the differences in stool metabolomics were not significant. Conclusions: Addition of bovine MFGM and LF in infant formula was associated with subtle differences in stool microbiome and metabolome by 4 mo of age, including increased prevalence of Bacteroides species. Stool metabolite profiles may be consistent with altered microbial metabolism.","2021-05","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-07-19 17:12:45","","","","5","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is very limited knowledge on bacterial communities that may play significant roles with algae in the bioconversion of manure nutrients to animal feed. In this study, water samples were collected during winter, spring, summer, and fall from the dairy lagoon effluent (DLE), high rate algae ponds (HRAP) that were fed with diluted DLE, and municipal waste water treatment plant (WWTP) effluent which was included as a comparison system for the analysis of total bacteria, Cyanobacteria, and microalgae communities using MiSeq Illumina sequencing targeting the 16S V4 rDNA region. The main objective was to examine dynamics in microbial community composition in the HRAP used for the production of algal biomass. DNA was extracted from the different sample types using three commercially available DNA extraction kits; MoBio Power water extraction kit, Zymo fungi/bacterial extraction kit, and MP Biomedicals FastDNA SPIN Kit. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using distance matrices on each variable showed significant differences (P = 0.001) in beta-diversity based on sample source. Environmental variables such as hydraulic retention time (HRT; P < 0.031), total N (P < 0.002), total inorganic N (P<0.002), total P (P < 0.002), alkalinity (P<0.002), pH (P<0.022), total suspended solid (TSS; P<0.003), and volatile suspended solids (VSS; P < 0.002) significantly affected microbial communities in DLE, HRAP, and WWTP. Of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified to phyla level, the dominant classes of bacteria identified were: Cyanobacteria, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Epsilon-, and Delta-proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. Our data suggest that microbial communities were significantly affected in HRAP by different environmental variables, and care must be taken in extraction procedures when evaluating specific groups of microbial communities for specific functions.

Exogenous enzymes promote nutrient digestibility and utilization and improve the intestinal environment. However, the specific regulation of the gut microbiome and metabolome by exogenous enzymes remains unelucidated. This study was conducted to evaluate effects of dietary multi-enzyme supplementation on egg and reproductive performance, egg quality, ileum microbiome, and metabolome of breeders. Here, 224 Hy-Line Brown breeding hens (55 weeks old) were randomly allocated to two groups: dietary controls fed basal diet (DC), and test hens fed 0.2 g/kg corn enzyme diet (CE). Serum levels of total protein, globulin, immunoglobulin Y, and antibodies against the Newcastle disease virus and avian influenza H9 strain were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Egg albumen height, Haugh unit, and fertilization and hatching rates were also significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the CE-fed group. 16S rRNA sequence analysis showed that CE strongly affected both alpha- and beta-diversity of the ileal microbiota. LEfSe analysis revealed that the potentially beneficial genera Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Faecalicoccus, and Streptococcus were enriched as biomarkers in the CE-fed group. Microbial functional analysis revealed that the functional genes associated with harmful-substance biodegradation was significantly increased in the CE-fed group. Additionally, Spearman correlation analysis indicated that changes in microbial genera were correlated with differential metabolites. In summary, dietary multi-enzyme addition can improve egg quality, humoral immunity, and reproductive performance and regulate the intestinal microbiome and metabolome in breeders. Therefore, multi-enzymes could be used as feed additive to extend breeder service life.","2021-12-03","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-06-30 18:30:14","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since bacterioplankton rapidly responds to any natural and human-induced disturbances in the environment, it can serve as a bioindicator of these changes. Knowing factors that shape the microbial community structure may help the sustainable management of the water environment. However, the identification of environmental signals affecting the structure and function of bacterioplankton is still a challenge. The study analyses the impact of environmental variables on basic microbial parameters, which determines the effectiveness of ecological processes in rivers. Measurements of bacterioplankton abundance (BA) and extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) were based on fluorescent markers. The bacterial community structure was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Illumina). The results indicate spatial variation in bacterioplankton abundance. Temporal variation was not significant. Lipase and aminopeptidase had the highest level of activity. EEA was not correlated with bacterial abundance but was significantly correlated with temperature. Moreover, differences in lipase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-glucosidase activity levels between spring and summer were noted. At the same time, the location of sampling site had a significant influence on aminopeptidase activity. The taxonomic analysis of bacterioplankton communities in the Brda River indicated that, although different numbers of OTUs were recorded in the studied river sections, bacterioplankton biodiversity did not change significantly along the river with distance downstream. Anthropogenically modified river sections were characterized by the dominance of Flavobacterium (Bacterioidetes) and hgcl clade (Actinobacteria) taxa, known for their ability to produce extracellular enzymes. PCoA analysis revealed that the sites located in the lower river course (urban area) had the most similar bacterial community structure (beta-diversity). The study provides new insight into the changes in microbial communities along the river and emphasizes the potential impact of anthropogenization on these processes.","2021-10","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-07-19 17:45:16","","","","20","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there is one pilot study evaluating the ocular surface of healthy dogs using NGS. Furthermore, alterations in the ocular surface microbiome over time and after topical antibiotic treatment are unknown. The objectives of this study were to describe the bacterial composition of the ocular surface microbiome in clinically normal dogs, and to determine if microbial community changes occur over time or following topical antibiotic therapy. Topical neomycin-polymyxin-bacitracin ophthalmic ointment was applied to one eye each of 13 adult dogs three times daily for seven days, while contralateral eyes served as untreated controls. The inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes was sampled via swabbing at baseline prior to antibiotic therapy (day 0), after 1 week of treatment (day 7), and 4 weeks after discontinuing treatment (day 35). Genomic DNA was extracted from the conjunctival swabs and primers targeting the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were used to generate amplicon libraries, which were then sequenced on an Illumina platform. Data were analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Molecular Ecology (QIIME 2.0). At baseline, the most relatively abundant phyla sequenced were Proteobacteria (49.7%), Actinobacteria (25.5%), Firmicutes (12%), Bacteroidetes (7.5%), and Fusobacteria (1.4%). The most common families detected were Pseudomonadaceae (13.2%), Micrococcaceae (12%), Pasteurellaceae (6.9%), Microbacteriaceae (5.2%), Enterobacteriaceae (3.9%), Neisseriaceae (3.5%), and Corynebacteriaceae (3.3%).

Although, there is an increasing understanding of the factors that affect microbial community composition in laboratory populations, the impact of environment and host community composition on microbiomes in wild populations is less understood. Given that the composition of bacterial communities can be shaped by ecological factors, particularly exposure to the microbiome of other individuals, inter-specific interactions should impact on microbiome community composition. Here, we evaluated inter-population and inter-specific similarity in the fecal microbiota of Przewalski's gazelle (Procapra przewalskii), an endangered endemic ruminant around Qinghai Lake in China. We compared the fecal bacterial communities of three Przewalski's gazelle populations, with those of two sympatric ruminants, Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata) and Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries). The fecal bacterial community richness (Chao1, ACE) did not vary across the three Przewalski's gazelle populations, nor did the composition vary between species. In contrast, the managed Przewalski's gazelle population had higher bacterial diversity (Shannon and Simpson) and was more similar to its sympatric Tibetan sheep in beta diversity than the wild Przewalski's gazelle populations. These results suggest that ecological factors like host community composition or diet affect Przewalski's gazelle's gastrointestinal bacterial community. The role of bacterial community composition in maintaining gastrointestinal health should be assessed to improve conservation management of endangered Przewalski's gazelle. More broadly, captive breeding and reintroduction efforts may be impeded, where captive management results in dysbiosis and introduction of pathogenic bacteria. In free ranging populations, where wildlife and livestock co-occur, infection by domestic pathogens and diseases may be an underappreciated threat to wild animals.</p>","2021-09-24","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-07-19 14:44:25","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-gazelle gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the microbiota-host as a unity, in which extrinsic (as food availability and geography) or intrinsic factors (as physiology) play an important role in the microbiota composition, we would expect differentiation in the microbiota of two geographically separated populations. The Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 68 individuals were analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We obtained a total of 11 566 (ASVs). The bacterial communities in the Central and Pacific populations had a diversity of 6,939 and 4,088 ASVs, respectively, sharing a core microbiota of 539 ASVs accounting for 75% of the relative abundance, suggesting stability over evolutionary time. The Weighted UniFrac metrics tested by a PERMANOVA showed that lactating and pregnant females had significant beta diversity differences in the two populations compared with other reproductive stages. This could be a consequence of the increased energy requirements of these physiological stages, more than the variation due to geographical separation. In contrast, a positive correlation of the observed ASVs of fecal microbiota with the observed ASVs of plastids related to the diet was observed in the juveniles and adults, suggesting that in these physiological stages an extrinsic factor as the diet shapes the microbiota composition. The results provide a baseline for future studies of the microbiome in these two wild populations of the lesser long-nosed bat, the main pollinator of the Agaves from which the beverages tequila and mezcal are made.","2020-06","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-07-19 15:30:18","","","","6","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-bat gut; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Setting and participants We included subjects from a longitudinal project involving H. pylori screening and treatment of junior high school third-grade students (aged 14 or 15 years) in Saga Prefecture. The study included a control group (n=79) and an H. pylori group (n=80) tested negative and positive for the anti-H. pylori antibody in the urine and H. pylori antigen in stool specimens, respectively. Interventions The intestinal microbiota was evaluated in stool specimens using 16S rRNA gene/DNA/amplicon sequencing with next-generation sequencing. Primary and secondary outcome measures We assessed alpha and beta diversity, just as well as relative abundances within the bacterial composition at the genus level in both groups. Results As shown by the alpha diversity of the 16S rRNA gene/DNA/amplicon sequence data, the control group exhibited lower microbial species richness with lower alpha diversity compared with the H. pylori group (p<0.001). The beta diversity of the intestinal microbiota profile also differed between the two groups (p<0.01). The relative abundance of the Prevotella genus was higher in the H. pylori group (p<0.01) concomitant with a gain in body mass index (BMI) in the H. pylori group (p<0.01) compared with the control group.

Extracted DNA was PCR amplified using barcoded 16S rRNA gene V4 primers. Sequenced libraries were processed using QIIME2. Phyloseq was used to calculate alpha- and beta- diversity measures. Biomarkers associated with case status were identified using ANCOM after adjustment for patient age, race and BMI. PICRUSt was used to identify microbial pathways associated with case status. Results Beta-diversity of microbial communities across each niche was significantly different (R2 = 0.25, p < 0.001). Alpha-diversity of the uterine microbiome was reduced in USC (Chao1, p = 0.004 and Fisher, p = 0.007) compared to EAC. Biomarkers from the three anatomical sites allowed samples to be clustered into two distinct clades that distinguished controls from USC cases (p = 0.042). The USC group was defined by 13 bacterial taxa across the three sites (W-stat>10, FDR<0.05) including depletion of cervicovaginal Lactobacillus and elevation of uterine Pseudomonas. PICRUSTt analysis revealed highly significant differences between the USC-associated clades within the cervicovaginal and uterine microbiota.

The composition of the termite gut microbiome correlates with phylogenetic distance of the animal host and host ecology (diet) in termites collected from their natural environment. However, carryover of transient microbes from host collection sites are an experimental concern and might contribute to the ecological imprints on the termite gut microbiome. Here, we set out to test whether an ecological imprint on the termite gut microbiome remains, when focusing on the persistent microbiome. Therefore, we kept five termite species under strictly controlled dietary conditions and subsequently profiled their protist and bacterial gut microbial communities using 18S and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The species differed in their ecology; while three of the investigated species were wood-dwellers that feed on the piece of wood they live in and never leave except for the mating flight, the other two species were foragers that regularly leave their nests to forage for food. Despite these prominent ecological differences, protist microbiome structure aligned with phylogenetic relatedness of termite host species. Conversely, bacterial communities seemed more flexible, suggesting that microbiome structure aligned more strongly with the foraging and wood-dwelling ecologies. Interestingly, protist and bacterial community alpha-diversity correlated, suggesting either putative interactions between protists and bacteria, or that both types of microbes in the termite gut follow shared structuring principles. Taken together, our results add to the notion that bacterial communities are more variable over evolutionary time than protist communities and might react more flexibly to changes in host ecology.","2017-12-19","2022-06-27 16:28:57","2022-06-27 17:24:52","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human skin harbors complex transient and resident microbial communities that show intra- & inter-individual variation due to various environmental and host-associated factors such as skin site, diet, age, gender, genetics, or the type and use of cosmetics. This variation remains largely uncharacterized in the Indian population; hence, the present study aims to characterize the variation in skin microbiota among individuals of Indian origin and quantify associations with age, diet, and geography. Methods. Axillary sweat samples from genetically unrelated individuals (N = 58) residing in the three geographical locations of Maharashtra, India, were collected using a sterile cotton swab. Bacterial DNA was extracted using a standard protocol and checked for quality. Variable regions (V3-V4) of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced using the Illumina platform. We used standard methods from microbiota bioinformatics, including alpha and beta diversity, community typing, and differential abundance, to quantify the association of skin microbiota with age, diet., and geographical location. Results. Our study indicated the prevalence of phyla- Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, consistent with previous reports on skin microbiota composition of the world population level. The alpha diversity (Shannon index) was significantly associated with the age group (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.02), but not with geography (p = 0.62) or diet (p = 0.74). The overall skin microbiota community composition was significantly associated with geographical location based on Community State Types (CST) analysis and PERMANOVA (R-2 = 0.07, p = 0.01). Differential abundance analysis at the genus level indicated a distinctively high abundance of Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium among individuals of the Pune district. Pseudomonas and Anaerococcus were abundant in individuals from Ahmednagar whereas, Paenibacillus, Geobacillus, Virgibacillus, Jeotgalicoccus, Pullulanibacillus, Delsulfosporomusa, Citinovibrio, and Calditerricola were abundant in individuals from Nashik district. Conclusion. Our work provides one of the first characterizations of skin microbiota variation in different sub-populations in India. The analysis quantifies the level of individuality, as contrasted to the other factors of age, geography, and diet, thus helping to evaluate the applicability of skin microbiota profiles as a potential biomarker to stratify individuals.","2022-03-16","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-19 17:10:32","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human skin; var-age; var-diet; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, we and others reported an association between APOE alleles and the gut microbiome. Here, we evaluated effects of APOE heterozygosity and tested whether these overall results extended to mice maintained under ideal conditions for microbiome analyses. To model human APOE alleles, this study used APOE targeted replacement (TR) mice on a C57Bl/6 background. To minimize genetic drift, homozygous APOE3 mice were crossed to homozygous APOE2 or homozygous APOE4 mice prior to the study, and the resulting heterozygous progeny crossed further to generate the study mice. To maximize environmental homogeneity, mice with mixed genotypes were housed together and used bedding from the cages was mixed and added back as a portion of new bedding. Fecal samples were obtained from mice at 3-, 5- and 7-months of age, and microbiota analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LefSe) identified taxa associated with APOE status, depicted as cladograms to show phylogenetic relatedness. The influence of APOE status was tested on alpha-diversity (Shannon H index) and beta-diversity (principal coordinate analyses and PERMANOVA). Individual taxa associated with APOE status were identified by classical univariate analysis. Whether findings in the APOE mice were replicated in humans was evaluated by using published microbiome genome wide association data. Cladograms revealed robust differences with APOE in male mice and limited differences in female mice. The richness and evenness (alpha-diversity) and microbial community composition (beta-diversity) of the fecal microbiome was robustly associated with APOE status in male but not female mice. Classical univariate analysis revealed individual taxa that were significantly increased or decreased with APOE, illustrating a stepwise APOE2-APOE3-APOE4 pattern of association with heterozygous animals trending as intermediate in the stepwise pattern. The relative abundance of bacteria from the class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, family Ruminococacceae and related genera increased with APOE2 status. The relative abundance of Erysipelotrichia increased with APOE4 status, a finding that extended to humans. In this study, wherein mice were maintained in an ideal fashion for microbiome studies, gut microbiome profiles were strongly and significantly associated with APOE status in male APOE-TR mice. Erysipelotrichia are increased with APOE4 in both mice and humans. APOE allelic effects appeared generally intermediate in heterozygous animals. Further evaluation of these findings in humans, as well as studies evaluating the impact of the APOE-associated microbiota on disease-relevant phenotypes, will be necessary to determine if alterations in the gut microbiome represent a novel mechanism whereby APOE alleles impact disease.","2022-02-03","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-06-30 16:58:36","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is unclear which taxa are associated with gut dysbiosis, and if particular gut regions or specific time periods during ontogeny are more susceptible. We also know very little of this process in non-model organisms, despite an increasing realization of the general importance of gut microbiota for health. Methods: Here, we examine the changes that occur in the microbiome during dysbiosis in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract in a long-lived bird with high juvenile mortality, the ostrich (Struthio camelus). We evaluated the 16S rRNA gene composition of the ileum, cecum, and colon of 68 individuals that died of suspected enterocolitis during the first 3 months of life (diseased individuals), and of 50 healthy individuals that were euthanized as age-matched controls. We combined these data with longitudinal environmental and fecal sampling to identify potential sources of pathogenic bacteria and to unravel at which stage of development dysbiosis-associated bacteria emerge. Results: Diseased individuals had drastically lower microbial alpha diversity and differed substantially in their microbial beta diversity from control individuals in all three regions of the gastrointestinal tract. The clear relationship between low diversity and disease was consistent across all ages in the ileum, but decreased with age in the cecum and colon. Several taxa were associated with mortality (Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Clostridium), while others were associated with health (Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Turicibacter, Roseburia). Environmental samples showed no evidence of dysbiosis-associated bacteria being present in either the food, water, or soil substrate. Instead, the repeated fecal sampling showed that pathobionts were already present shortly after hatching and proliferated in individuals with low microbial diversity, resulting in high mortality several weeks later. Conclusions: Identifying the origins of pathobionts in neonates and the factors that subsequently influence the establishment of diverse gut microbiota may be key to understanding dysbiosis and host development.","2020-10-12","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-18 21:50:00","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-ostrich gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have reported significant association between nutritional status and gut microbiome composition but other factors such as demographic settings may also influence the adult microbiome. The relationship between undernourishment and gut microbiome in adults has not been described to date. In this study, we compared the gut microbiome in fecal samples of 48 individuals, from two demographic settings (rural and urban slum) in Karnataka, India using 16S rRNA sequencing. Nutritional status was assessed based on BMI, with a BMI of < 18.5 kg/m(2) classified as undernourished, and a BMI in the range 18.5-25 kg/m(2) as nourished. We analyzed 25 individuals from rural settings (12 undernourished and 13 nourished) and 23 individuals from urban slum settings (11 undernourished and 12 nourished). We found no significant difference in overall gut microbial diversity (Shannon and Unweighted UniFrac) between undernourished and nourished individuals in either geographical settings, however, microbial taxa at the phylum level (i.e., Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) and beta diversity (unweighted UniFrac) differed significantly between the rural and urban slum settings. By predicting microbial function from 16S data profiling we found significant differences in metabolic pathways present in the gut microbiota from people residing in different settings; specifically, those related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The weighted sum of the KEGG Orthologs associated with carbohydrate metabolism (Spearman's correlation coefficient, rho = -0.707, p < 0.001), lipid metabolism (Spearman's correlation coefficient, rho = -0.330, p < 0.022) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (Spearman's correlation coefficient, rho = -0.507, p < 0.001) were decreased in the urban slum group compared to the rural group.

Methods: We characterized the 16S rDNA fecal microbiome in 42 cervical cancer patients and 46 healthy female controls. Shannon diversity index (SDI) was used to evaluate alpha (within sample) diversity. Beta (between sample) diversity was examined using principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) of unweighted Unifrac distances. Relative abundance of microbial taxa was compared between samples using Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe). Results: Within cervical cancer patients, bacterial alpha diversity was positively correlated with age (p = 0.22) but exhibited an inverse relationship in control subjects (p < 0.01). Alpha diversity was significantly higher in cervical cancer patients as compared to controls (p < 0.05), though stratification by age suggested this relationship was restricted to older women (>50 years; p < 0.01). Beta diversity (unweighted Unifrac; p < 0.01) also significantly differed between cervical cancer patients and controls. Based on age- and race-adjusted LEfSe analysis, multiple taxa significantly differed between cervical cancer patients and controls. Prevotella, Porphyromonas, and Dialister were significantly enriched in cervical cancer patients, while Bacteroides, Alistipes and members of the Lachnospiracea family were significantly enriched in healthy subjects. Conclusion: Our study suggests differences in gut microbiota diversity and composition between cervical cancer patients and controls. Associations within the gut microbiome by age may reflect etiologic/clinical differences. These findings provide rationale for further study of the gut microbiome in cervical cancer.

This can shift their microbiome composition towards pathogen-dominated communities. Understanding the impact of temperature on the microbiome will facilitate oyster health management. Aims The present study was conducted to (1) assess the Pacific oyster microbiome at different temperatures (21 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 26 degrees C and diurnal fluctuation between 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C) and (2) investigate microbiome changes in response to exposure to the pathogen Ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) at different temperatures. Methods Pacific oysters (15 months of age; n = 480) were acclimated to different temperatures in laboratory aquaria. Samples were obtained before and after acclimation and after OsHV-1 exposure for quantification of OsHV-1, total bacteria and Vibrio, by quantitative PCR. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene (V1-V3) sequences were used to characterise the gill bacterial community. Key results The alpha diversity (number of observed amplicon sequence variants) and total number of bacteria associated with the gills of oysters did not change with acclimation to different water temperature profiles, but there was variation in beta diversity. The highest mortality after OsHV-1 exposure occurred at 26 degrees C and these, together with oysters at 22/26 degrees C, had a higher concentration of OsHV-1 DNA compared with to the ones at the lower constant temperatures (P < 0.05). The total bacterial quantity increased after the OsHV-1 challenge in oysters at 22/26 degrees C. The alpha diversity of microbiota increased after the OsHV-1 challenge in oysters at 21 degrees C and 22/26 degrees C. The beta diversity changed both after acclimation and OsHV-1 challenge. The highest abundance of Vibrio and higher OsHV-1 loads were seen in OsHV-1-challenged oysters at 26 degrees C (P < 0.05). Conclusions The gill microbiome altered with seawater temperature and OsHV-1 challenge. Higher mortality following OsHV-1 exposure was associated with a higher water temperature and greater abundance of Vibrio spp. arising from the microbiome. Implications Higher seawater temperature can be considered a key risk factor influencing oyster health by altering the microbiome, increasing susceptibility to OsHV-1 and increasing the Vibrio fraction in the oyster microbiome.","","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-01 14:54:42","","","","SI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article; Early Access","","","","16S sequencing; biome-oysters; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies suggest that both sleep fragmentation (SF) and dysbiosis of the gut microbiome can lead to metabolic disorders, though the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. To better understand the consequences of SF, we investigated the effects of acute (6 days) and chronic (6 weeks) SF on rats by examining taxonomic profiles of microbiota in the distal ileum, cecum and proximal colon, as well as assessing structural and functional integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier. We further assayed the impact of SF on a host function by evaluating inflammation and immune response. Both acute and chronic SF induced microbial dysbiosis, more dramatically in the distal ileum (compared to other two regions studied), as noted by significant perturbations in alpha- and beta-diversity; though, specific microbial populations were significantly altered throughout each of the three regions. Furthermore, chronic SF resulted in increased crypt depth in the distal ileum and an increase in the number of villi lining both the cecum and proximal colon. Additional changes were noted with chronic SF, including: decreased microbial adhesion and penetration in the distal ileum and cecum, elevation in serum levels of the cytokine KC/GRO, and depressed levels of corticotropin. Importantly, our data show that perturbations to microbial ecology and intestinal morphology intensify in response to prolonged SF and these changes are habitat specific. Together, these results reveal consequences to gut microbiota homeostasis and host response following acute and chronic SF in rats.","2020","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-19 15:09:30","","","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on gut microbes of endangered birds is vital for their conservation. However, a thorough understanding of the gut microbiome composition present in crested ibises at different ages and its correlation with crested ibis reproductive capacity has remained elusive. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to explore the fecal microbial structure of nestlings and adult birds, and the difference in gut microbiota between healthy and sterile crested ibises. We observed that (1) bacterial microbiota, alpha and beta diversity of one-day-old nestlings significantly distinguished from other nestlings; abundance of Proteobacteria decreased, while that of Fusobacteria increased with an increase in the age of the nestlings; (2) there was no significant difference in community composition among adult crested ibises aged one, two, three, and five years; (3) the abundance of Proteobacteria and alpha diversity indices were higher in sterile crested ibises than in healthy crested ibises; thus, Proteobacteria can act as a diagnostic biomarker of reproductive dysfunction in crested ibises. This study significantly contributes to the field of ecology and conservation, as it provides a platform for assessing the reproductive capacity of endangered crested ibises, based on the gut microbiota composition. Further studies may unravel additional factors influencing crested ibises' reproductive health, which will further help the management and control of the crested ibis population.","2021","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-06-30 17:01:58","","","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: To assess associations between healthy food choices and human gut microbiota composition, and to determine the strength of association with functional potential. Methods: This population-based study sample consisted of 4930 participants (ages 25-74; 53% women) in the FINRISK 2002 study. Intakes of recommended foods were assessed using a food propensity questionnaire, and responses were transformed into healthy food choices (HFC) scores. Microbial diversity (alpha diversity) and compositional differences (beta diversity) and their associations with the HFC score and its components were assessed using linear regression. Multiple permutational multivariate ANOVAs were run from whole-metagenome shallow shotgun-sequenced samples. Associations between specific taxa and HFC were analyzed using linear regression. Functional associations were derived from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologies with linear regression models. Results: Both microbial alpha diversity (beta/SD, 0.044; SE, 6.18 x 10(-5); P = 2.21 x 10(-3)) and beta diversity (R-2, 0.12; P <= 1.00 x 10(-3)) were associated with the HFC score. For alpha diversity, the strongest associations were observed for fiber-rich breads, poultry, fruits, and low-fat cheeses (all positive). For beta diversity, the most prominent associations were observed for vegetables, followed by berries and fruits. Genera with fiber-degrading and SCFA-producing capacities were positively associated with the HFC score. The HFC score was associated positively with functions such as SCFA metabolism and synthesis, and inversely with functions such as fatty acid biosynthesis and the sulfur relay system. Conclusions: Our results from a large, population-based survey confirm and extend findings of other, smaller-scale studies that plant and fiber-rich dietary choices are associated with a more diverse and compositionally distinct microbiota, and with a greater potential to produce SCFAs.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-19 18:16:44","","605-616","","2","114","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The oropharyngeal microbiota is the major reservoir of infection. This study explored the relative contributions of time in hospital and patient demographics to the community structure of the oropharyngeal microbiota in older patients with lower limb fracture. We collected 167 throat swabs from 53 patients (mean age 83) over 14 days after hospitalization, and analyzed these using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We calculated frailty/comorbidity indices, undertook dental examinations and collected data on respiratory tract infections. We analyzed microbial community composition using correspondence (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis. Ten patients were treated for respiratory tract infection. Microbial community structure was related to frailty, number of teeth and comorbidity on admission, with comorbidity exerting the largest effect. Time in hospital neither significantly changed alpha (t = -0.910, p = 0.365) nor beta diversity (CA1 t = 0.022, p = 0.982; CA2 t = -0.513, p = 0.609) of microbial communities in patient samples. Incidence of respiratory pathogens were not associated with time in hospital (t = -0.207, p = 0.837), nor with alpha diversity of the oral microbiota (t = -1.599, p = 0.113). Patient characteristics at admission, rather than time in hospital, influenced the community structure of the oral microbiota.","2018-02-20","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-19 18:20:33","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results This was a multiple case-control study of women at childbearing age who were assigned to case or control groups according to their states of urogenital tract infections. The participants were also grouped by childbearing history and menstrual cycle. Vaginal swabs were collected and stored at - 70 degrees C until assayed. The V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified using PCR and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We tested the hypothesis of whether the relative abundance of microbial species in vaginal microbiota was varied with urogenital tract infections, childbearing history and menstrual cycle. The vaginal microbial richness (Alpha diversity measured by PD_whole tree) was decreased in normal women (without reproductive tract infections) than in those with bacterial vaginosis (BV), and decreased in pregnant women than in other groups of non-pregnancy. Similarly, women from groups of normal and in pregnancy had lower beta diversity on measure of unweighted_unifrac distance in comparison to those of infected and non-pregnant. The top 10 genus relative abundance, especially Lactobacillus, which was the most dominant genus with the relative abundance of 71.55% among all samples, did not differ significantly between groups of childbearing history and menstrual cycle analyzed by ANOVA and nonparametric kruskal_wallis. Lactobacillus iners and Lactobacillus helveticus have the most abundance, totally account for 97.92% relative abundance of genus Lactobacillus. We also found that a higher L.helveticus/L.iners ratio is more likely to present in normal women than in the infected and in pregnant than in non-pregnant, although these comparisons lack statistical significance. Conclusions The relative abundance of dominant bacterial taxa in vaginal microbial communities of women at childbearing age were not different among groups of childbearing history and menstrual cycle. Women from groups of in pregnancy and without reproductive tract infections had lower alpha and beta diversity. The composition of the main lactobacillus species may shift upon phases of a menstrual cycle and the status of reproductive tract infections.","2021-09-21","2022-06-27 16:28:58","2022-07-19 18:04:29","","","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human vagina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study objective was to test for differences in the upper airway microbiome of children with CF and healthy controls and age-related differences in children with CF. Methods: Oropharyngeal swabs and clinical data were obtained from 25 children with CF and 50 healthy controls aged <= 6 years. Bacterial DNA was amplified and sequenced for the V4 region of 16S rRNA marker-gene. Alpha diversity was measured using operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Shannon diversity, and the inverse Simpson's index. Beta diversity was measured using Morisita-Horn and Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distances. General linear models were used for comparison of alpha diversity measures between groups to account for differences in demographics and exposures. Mixed effects general linear models were used for longitudinal comparisons 1) between children with CF of different ages and 2) between children with CF receiving CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators, children with CF not receiving CFTR modulators, and healthy controls to adjust for repeated measures per subject. Results: Children with CF were more likely to have received antibiotics in the prior year than healthy controls (92% vs 24%, p < 0.001). Controlling age, race, ethnicity, length of breastfeeding, and having siblings, children with CF had a lower richness than healthy controls: OTUs 62.1 vs 83, p = 0.022; and trended toward lower diversity: Shannon 2.09 vs 2.35, p = 0.057; inverse Simpson 5.7 vs 6.92, p = 0.118. Staphylococcus, three Rothia OTUs, and two Streptococcus OTUs were more abundant in CF children versus healthy controls (all p < 0.05). Bray-Curtis and Jaccard distances, which reflect overall microbial community composition, were also significantly different (both p = 0.001). In longitudinally collected samples from children with CF, Morisita-Horn trended toward more similarity in those aged 0-2 years compared to those aged 3-6 years (p = 0.070). In children >2 years of age, there was a significant trend in increasing alpha diversity measures between children with CF not receiving CFTR modulators, children with CF receiving CFTR modulators, and healthy controls: OTUs 63.7 vs 74.7 vs 97.6, p < 0.001; Shannon 2.11 vs 2.34 vs 2.56, p < 0.001; inverse Simpson 5.78 vs 7.23 vs 7.96, p < 0.001. Conclusions: Children with CF have lower bacterial diversity and different composition of organisms compared with healthy controls. This appears to start in early childhood, is possibly related to the use of antibiotics, and may be partially corrected with the use of CFTR modulators.","2020-06","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-07-19 15:22:45","","","","6","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there has been relatively little focus upon the implications of the gut microbiome in retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Here, we investigated changes in gut microbiome composition linked to RP, by assessing both retinal degeneration and gut microbiome in the rd10 mouse model of RP as compared to control C57BL/6J mice. In rd10 mice, retinal responsiveness to flashlight stimuli and visual acuity were deteriorated with respect to observed in age-matched control mice. This functional decline in dystrophic animals was accompanied by photoreceptor loss, morphologic anomalies in photoreceptor cells and retinal reactive gliosis. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data showed a microbial gut dysbiosis with differences in alpha and beta diversity at the genera, species and amplicon sequence variants (ASV) levels between dystrophic and control mice. Remarkably, four fairly common ASV in healthy gut microbiome belonging to Rikenella spp., Muribaculaceace spp., Prevotellaceae UCG-001 spp., and Bacilli spp. were absent in the gut microbiome of retinal disease mice, while Bacteroides caecimuris was significantly enriched in mice with RP. The results indicate that retinal degenerative changes in RP are linked to relevant gut microbiome changes. The findings suggest that microbiome shifting could be considered as potential biomarker and therapeutic target for retinal degenerative diseases.","2021-03-23","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-06-30 17:03:28","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The present work aimed to explore the associations between usual diet and gut microbiota composition in a large sample of healthy French adults. Methods: Gut microbiota composition was established through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in stool samples from 862 healthy French adults of the Milieu Interieur study. Usual dietary consumptions were determined through the administration of a food-frequency questionnaire. The associations between dietary variables and alpha- and beta-diversity indexes and relative taxa abundances were tested using Spearman correlations, permutational ANOVAs, and multivariate analyses with linear models, respectively. Results: Foods generally considered as healthy (raw fruits, fish) were positively associated with alpha-diversity, whereas food items for which a limited consumption is generally recommended (fried products, sodas or sugary drinks, fatty sweet products, processed meats, ready-cooked meals, and desserts) were negatively associated with alpha-diversity. Fruits, fried products, ready-cooked meals, and cheese contributed to shifts within microbiota composition (beta-diversity). Our results also highlighted a number of associations between various food group intakes and abundances of specific phyla, genera, and species. For instance, the consumption of cheese was negatively associated with Akkermansia muciniphila abundance. Conclusions: This large-scale population-based study supports that the usual consumption of certain food items is associated with several gut microbial features, and extends the mechanistic arguments linking Western diet to an altered microbiota composition. These results provide new insights into the understanding of complex diet-gut microbiota relations, and their implications for host health deserve further investigation because altered microbiota diversity was consistently linked to increased risk of several health outcomes.

Additionally, alterations of the gut microbiota have been demonstrated to contribute to sepsis-related mortality. We sought to determine if there were alterations in the gut microbiota with a novel sepsis model in old adult mice, which enter a state of persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism (PICS), as compared with young adult mice, which recover with the sepsis model. Methods: Mixed sex old (similar to 20 mo) and young (similar to 4 mo) C57Bl/6J mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture with daily chronic stress (CLP+DCS) and were compared with naive age-matched controls. Mice were sacrificed at CLP+DCS day 7 and feces collected for bacterial DNA isolation. The V3-V4 hypervariable region was amplified, 16S rRNA gene sequencing performed, and cohorts compared. alpha-Diversity was assessed using Chao1 and Shannon indices using rarefied counts, and beta-diversity was assessed using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. Results: Naive old adult mice had significantly different alpha and beta-diversity compared with naive adult young adult mice. After CLP+DCS, there was a significant shift in the alpha and beta-diversity (FDR = 0.03 for both) of old adult mice (naive vs. CLP+DCS). However, no significant shift was displayed in the microbiota of young mice that underwent CLP+DCS in regards to alpha-diversity (FDR = 0.052) and beta-diversity (FDR = 0.12), demonstrating a greater overall stability of their microbiota at 7 days despite the septic insult. The taxonomic changes in old mice undergoing CLP+DCS were dominated by decreased abundance of the order Clostridiales and genera Oscillospira. Conclusion: Young adult mice maintain an overall microbiome stability 7 days after CLP+DCS after compared with old adult mice. The lack of microbiome stability could contribute to PICS and worse long-term outcomes in older adult sepsis survivors. Further studies are warranted to elucidate mechanistic pathways and potential therapeutics.","2021-04","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-07-19 19:23:52","","519-525","","4","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MethodsC57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat/sucrose diet (HFD) for 4 weeks before and throughout pregnancy to induce a model of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Body weight, glycolipid metabolic parameters, and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were assessed in the experimental process.

ITF (3.33 g/kg/day) treatment improved glucose and lipid metabolism disorder parameters in HFD-induced GDM mice and alleviated fat accumulation and glucose intolerance. The alpha diversity of the gut microbial community was increased in ITF mice, while the beta diversity returned to the level of normal chow diet (NCD) mice. Interestingly, Verrucomicrobia, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia were obviously enriched, while Dubosiella was obviously lessened after inulin treatment. Further analysis indicated that Dubosiella was positively correlated with markers of glycolipid metabolism disorders, whereas the ITF-supplemented diet partially reversed the changes.

We compare the gut microbiota of women who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with that of those who did not, and the gut microbiota of their offspring, to determine any differences in the composition and diversity of their gut microbiota, which may be correlated with their GDM state. Material and methods All women were at high risk for GDM and participated in the Finnish Gestational Diabetes Prevention Study (RADIEL). Stool samples were obtained, 5years postpartum, from 60 GDM-positive women, 68 non-GDM control women, and their children (n=109), 237 individuals in total. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was employed to determine the composition of bacterial communities present. Statistical correlations were inferred between clinical variables and microbiota, while taking into account potential confounders. Results In mothers, no significant differences were observed in microbiota composition between the two groups. Genus Anaerotruncus was increased in children of women with GDM (p<0.001). Beta-diversity measures showed that a mother and her child have a more similar microbiome composition when compared with unrelated children, other mothers, or the children compared with each other (p<0.001). Conclusions These results suggest that there may be no discernible microbiome basis to GDM susceptibility in high-risk women, whereas microbiome differences between the offspring could be of greater biological significance. The heterogeneous nature of the disease could be obscuring potential differences between women. A longer time-series study, with carefully defined subject subgroups, may be an appropriate course of future investigation into GDM and the microbiome.","2018-01","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-06-30 20:40:55","","38-46","","1","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have suggested a parallel segregation of microbial features and psychological burden in IBS. This study aimed at exploring the microbial correlates of psychological distress in patients with IBS. Methods Forty-eight patients with IBS (Rome III criteria, M (SD) age = 42 (15) years, 35 female, 25 diarrhea-dominant, 5 constipation-dominant, and 18 alternating-type IBS) were assessed for psychological and clinical variables with validated questionnaires, fecal samples underwent microbial 16S rRNA analyses (regions V1-2). Microbial analyses comprised examination of alpha and beta diversity, correlational analyses of bacterial abundance and comparisons among subgroups defined by thresholds of psychological and IBS symptom variables, and machine learning to identify bacterial patterns corresponding with psychological distress. Results Thirty-one patients (65%) showed elevated psychological distress, 22 (31%) anxiety, and 10 depression (21%). Microbial beta diversity was significantly associated with distress and depression (q = .036 each, q values are p values false discovery rate-corrected for multiple testing). Depression was negatively associated with Lachnospiraceae abundance (Spearman's = -0.58, q = .018).

The black soldier fly is considered a promising candidate insect for cultivation, with the larvae of this species being capable of converting agri-waste materials into valuable products that can be used as alternatives to conventional, environmentally detrimental animal feedstuffs, such as processed soy and fish commodities. The biodegradative performance of this species is underscored by the activity of intestinal microorganisms, suggesting that knowledge of larval microbial diversity may be valuable for ensuring sustainability and continual improvement of commercial black soldier fly colonies. In this study, the factors that shape the identity and function of larval gut microbial populations were evaluated. It was determined that both host genetics and diet alter the diversity and metabolic potential of intestinal bacteria, with potential downstream effects on economically important larval rearing traits. Therefore, the findings of this study provide a foundation for expanding and exploiting knowledge of the interactions between black soldier flies and their resident microbial communities for optimisation of insect farming practices. Mass rearing the black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, for waste bioremediation and valorisation is gaining traction on a global scale. While the health and productivity of this species are underpinned by associations with microbial taxa, little is known about the factors that govern gut microbiome assembly, function, and contributions towards host phenotypic development in actively feeding larvae. In the present study, a 16S rDNA gene sequencing approach applied to a study system incorporating both feed substrate and genetic variation is used to address this knowledge gap. It is determined that the alpha diversity of larval gut bacterial communities is driven primarily by features of the larval feed substrate, including the diversity of exogenous bacterial populations. Microbiome beta diversity, however, demonstrated patterns of differentiation consistent with an influence of diet, larval genetic background, and a potential interaction between these factors. Moreover, evidence for an association between microbiome structure and the rate of larval fat accumulation was uncovered. Taxonomic enrichment analysis and clustering of putative functional gut profiles further suggested that feed-dependent turnover in microbiome communities is most likely to impact larval characteristics. Taken together, these findings indicate that host-microbiome interactions in this species are complex yet relevant to larval trait emergence.","2021-12","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-06-29 17:14:49","","","","12","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fly gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SHIP deficient mice develop fully penetrant, spontaneous ileitis at 6 weeks of age, and thus offer a tractable model of Crohn's disease-like inflammation. Since disruptions to the microbiome are implicated in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease, we conducted a 16S rRNA gene survey of the ileum, cecum, colon, and stool contents of SHIP+/+ and SHIP-/- mice. We predicted that diversity and compositional changes would occur after, and possibly prior to, the onset of overt disease. No differences were found in alpha diversity, but significant changes in beta diversity and specific commensal populations were observed in the ileal compartment of SHIP deficient mice after the onset of overt disease. Specifically, reductions in the Bacteroidales taxa, Muribaculum intestinale, and an expansion in Lactobacillus were most notable. In contrast, expansions to bacterial taxa previously associated with inflammation, including Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella were observed in the ilea of SHIP deficient mice prior to the onset of overt disease. Finally, antibiotic treatment reduced the development of intestinal inflammation in SHIP-/- mice. Thus, our findings indicate that SHIP is involved in maintaining ileal microbial homeostasis. These results have broader implications for humans, since reduced SHIP protein levels have been reported in people with Crohn's disease.","2019-09-03","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-07-19 17:08:21","","578-598","","5","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two recent studies in adults demonstrated associations between socioeconomic factors and microbiome composition. This study expands on this prior work by examining the association between family socioeconomic status (SES) and host genetics with microbiome composition in infants and children. Methods: Family SES was used to predict a latent variable representing six genera abundances generated from whole-genome shotgun sequencing. A polygenic score derived from a microbiome genome-wide association study was included to control for potential genetic associations. Associations between family SES and microbiome diversity were assessed. Results: Anaerostipes, Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae spp. significantly loaded onto a latent factor, which was significantly predicted by SES (p < 0.05) but not the polygenic score (p > 0.05). Our results indicate that SES did not predict alpha diversity but did predict beta diversity (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that modifiable environmental factors influence gut microbiome composition at an early age. These results are important as our understanding of gut microbiome influences on health continue to expand.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-06-30 20:30:03","","","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-socioeconomic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Short-term preoperative antibiotics have been adopted to reduce site infections in colorectal cancer (CRC) resections. We hypothesize that the antibiotics will impact analysis of multi-omic datasets generated from resection samples to investigate biological CRC risk factors. AIM To assess the impact of preoperative antibiotics and other variables on integrated microbiome and human transcriptomic data generated from archived CRC resection samples. METHODS Genomic DNA (gDNA) and RNA were extracted from prospectively collected 51 pairs of frozen sporadic CRC tumor and adjacent non-tumor mucosal samples from 50 CRC patients archived at a single medical center from 2010-2020. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3V4 region, paired end, 300 bp) and confirmatory quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were conducted on gDNA. RNA sequencing (IPE, 125 bp) was performed on parallel tumor and non-tumor RNA samples with RNA Integrity Numbers scores >= 6. RESULTS PERMANOVA detected significant effects of tumor vs nontumor histology (P = 0.002) and antibiotics (P = 0.001) on microbial beta-diversity, but CRC tumor location (left vs right), diabetes mellitus vs not diabetic and Black/African Ancestry (AA) vs not Black/AA, did not reach significance. Linear mixed models detected significant tumor vs nontumor histology*antibiotics interaction terms for 14 genus level taxa. QPCR confirmed increased Fusobacterium abundance in tumor vs nontumor groups, and detected significantly reduced bacterial load in the (+)antibiotics group. Principal coordinate analysis of the transcriptomic data showed a clear separation between tumor and nontumor samples. Differentially expressed genes obtained from separate analyses of tumor and nontumor samples, are presented for the antibiotics, CRC location, diabetes and Black/AA race groups. CONCLUSION Recent adoption of additional preoperative antibiotics as standard of care, has a measurable impact on -omics analysis of resected specimens. This study still confirmed increased Fusobacterium nucleatum in tumor.","2021-04-14","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-06-29 17:19:21","","","","14","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-antibiotics; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As regional factors may affect microbial communities, it is unclear if a microbial signature of PSC exists across different geographical regions. Aims To identify a robust microbial signature of PSC independent of geography and environmental influences. Methods We included 388 individuals (median age, 47 years; range, 15-78) from Germany and Norway in the study, 137 patients with PSC (n = 75 with colitis), 118 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 133 healthy controls. Faecal microbiomes were analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V1-V2). Differences in relative abundances of single taxa were subjected to a meta-analysis. Results In both cohorts, microbiota composition (beta-diversity) differed between PSC patients and controls (P < 0.001). Random forests classification discriminated PSC patients from controls in both geographical cohorts with an average area under the curve of 0.88. Compared to healthy controls, many new cohort-spanning alterations were identified in PSC, such as an increase of Proteobacteria and the bile-tolerant genus Parabacteroides, which were detected independent from geographical region. Associated colitis only had minor effects on microbiota composition, suggesting that PSC itself drives the faecal microbiota changes observed. Conclusion Compared to healthy controls, numerous microbiota alterations are reproducible in PSC patients across geographical regions, clearly pointing towards a microbiota composition that is shaped by the disease itself and not by environmental factors. These reproducibly altered microbial populations might provide future insights into the pathophysiology of PSC.","2019-09","2022-06-27 16:28:59","2022-06-30 17:00:24","","580-589","","5","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different nutritional ingredients can either promote or prevent caries development. To investigate the effects of selected ingredients on the oral biofilm microbiota in situ, 11 study participants underwent 3-month-long dietary phases with intake of a regular diet (PI), additional frequent sucrose (PII), milk and yoghurt (PIII), and a diet rich in dietary fiber (PIV) and then returned to their regular diet (PV). Oral biofilm was sampled and analyzed applying 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Additionally, the effect on the enamel was analyzed by measuring enamel surface roughness with laser scanning microscopy. The beta-diversity results showed that the microbiota in all the following phases differed significantly from PI and that the microbial community in PII was significantly different from all other phases. The abundance of the genus Streptococcus fluctuated over the course of the five phases, with a significant increase in PII (P = 0.01), decreasing in PIII and PIV (PIII and PIV versus PII: P < 0.00001) and increasing again toward PV. Other taxa showed various fluctuations of their abundances, with PV returning approximately to the levels of PI. In conclusion, while elevated sucrose consumption favored caries-promoting non-mutans streptococci, frequent milk and yoghurt intake caused a significant decrease in the abundance of these microbial taxa and in addition reduced enamel surface roughness. These results indicate that modulations of the oral biofilm microbiota can be attained even in adults through dietary changes and corresponding recommendations can be made for the prevention of caries development. IMPORTANCE Caries affects a large proportion of the population worldwide, resulting in high treatment costs. Its etiology can be ascribed to shifts of the microbiota in dental biofilms primarily driven by dietary factors. It is unclear how diet affects the microbial community of plaque biofilm in situ and whether it can be modulated to help prevent caries development. To address these issues, we analyzed changes of the in situ plaque microbiota following 3-month-long dietary changes involving elevated sucrose, dairy, and dietary fiber consumption over a period of 15 months. Applying high-throughput sequencing, we found non-mutans streptococci, a taxonomic group involved in the beginning stages toward microbial dysbiosis, in decreased abundance with elevated dairy and dietary fiber intake. Through analysis of the enamel surface roughness, these effects were confirmed. Therefore, correspondent dietary measures can be recommended for children as well as adults for caries prevention.","2020-10","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 19:17:25","","","","20","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-diet; var-disease; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the gut microbiome has been implicated, little is known about how early diet affects the small intestine microbiome. Objective: We hypothesized that disparate early diets would promote unique microbial profiles in the small intestines of neonatal pigs. Methods: Male and female 2-d-old White Dutch Landrace pigs were either sow fed or provided dairy (Similac Advance powder; Ross Products Abbott Laboratories) or soy (Enfamil Prosobee Lipil powder; Mead Johnson Nutritionals) infant formulas until day 21. Bacterial ecology was assessed in the contents of the small intestine through the use of 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. alpha-Diversity, beta-diversity, and differential abundances of operational taxonomic units were assessed by ANOVA, permutational ANOVA, and negative binomial regression, respectively. Ileum tissue metabolomics were measured by LC-mass spectrometry and assessed by weighted correlation network analysis. Results: Greater a-diversity was observed in the duodena of sow-fed compared with formula-fed neonatal pigs (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in the ilea. Firmicutes represented the most abundant phylum across all diets in duodena (78.8%, 80.1%, and 53.4% relative abundance in sow, dairy, and soy groups, respectively), followed by Proteobacteria in sow (12.2%) and dairy (12.4%) groups and Cyanobacteria in soy-fed (36.2%) pigs. In contrast to those in the duodenum, Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in the ileum, with >60% relative abundance in all of the groups. In the duodenum, 77 genera were altered by diet, followed by 48 in the jejunum and 19 in the ileum. Metabolomics analyses revealed associations between ileum tissue metabolites (e.g., acylcarnitines, 3-aminoisobutyric acid) and diet-responsive microbial genera. Conclusions: These results indicate that the neonatal diet has regional effects on the small intestine microbiome in pigs, with the most pronounced effects occurring in the duodena. Regional effects may be important factorswhen considering gut tissuemetabolism and development in the postnatal period.","2017-08","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 17:50:09","","1499-1509","","8","147","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-pig gut; var-diet; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Long-distance dispersal might also spread micro-organisms across large geographical areas. However, so far, to which extent selection mechanisms that shape host's population genetics are mirrored in the population structure of the enteric microbiome remains unclear. High dispersal rates and horizontal parental transfer may homogenize bacterial communities between breeding sites (homogeneous hypothesis). Alternatively, strong selection from the local environment may differentiate bacterial communities between breeding sites (heterogeneous hypothesis). Furthermore, selection from age-specific environmental or physiological factors may differentiate the microbiome between juveniles and adults. Here, we analyzed the cloacal bacterial 16S rRNA gene of fledgling greater flamingos, Phoenicopterus roseus, across nine western Mediterranean breeding sites and four breeding seasons (n = 731) and adult birds (n = 27) from a single site. We found that fledgling cloacal microbiome, as measured by alpha diversity, beta diversity, the relative abundance of assigned sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to a phylum and genus composition within phylum, varied significantly between sampling sites and across time within site despite high adult dispersal rates. The spatio-temporal effects were stronger on individual ASV absence/presence than on ASV abundance (i.e., than on core microbiome composition). Spatial effects had a stronger effect than temporal effects, particularly on ASV abundance. Our study supports the heterogeneous hypothesis whereby local environmental conditions select and differentiate bacterial communities, thus countering the homogenizing effects of high-dispersing host species. In addition, differences in core microbiome between adult vs. fledgling samples suggests that differences in age-specific environmental and/or physiological factors result in differential selection pressure of core enteric microbiome between age classes, even within the same environment. In particular, the genus Corynebacterium, associated with both seasonal fat uptake and migration in previous studies, was much more abundant in high-dispersing fledglings than in more resident adults. To conclude, selection mechanisms that shape the host's genetic structure cannot be extended to the genetic structure of the enteric microbiome, which has important implications regarding our understanding of both host local adaptation mechanisms and enteric microbiome population genetics.","2019-02-06","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-18 22:24:41","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-flamingo gut; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After weaning at (35 days), young rabbits were exclusively fed solid feed. Three experimental feeds were used: a high concentrate diet [H: 10.16 MJ digestible energy (DE)/kg and 15.3% crude protein (CP)], a low concentrate diet (L: 9.33 MJ DE/kg and 14.7% CP) and a reproductive female diet (R: 10.57 MJ DE/kg and 17.3% CP). The rabbit kits (n = 357) were divided into three groups, differing by the diet received during two periods: from 18 to 28 and from 28 to 49 days of age. In the groups LL and HH, rabbit kits were fed L or H diets, respectively, during both periods. Kits in the group RL received feeds R and L from 18 to 28 and 28 to 49 days of age, respectively. Cecal bacterial communities of 10 rabbits per group were carried out at 18, 28, 35, 43 and 49 days of age by MiSeq Illumine sequencing 16S rRNA encoding genes. Between 18 and 28 days of age, solid feed intake was higher in the group RL compared to the other two groups (+24%; P < 0.01). Overall, 13.4% of the OTUs detected were present in the cecal ecosystem from 18 to 49 days old, whereas 17.4% were acquired with the onset of solid feeding and kept from 28 days on.

Introduction of solid feed induced a sharp change of microbial community structure and decreased phylogenetic diversity. A strong relationship in bacterial community network occurred only from 43 days on.

We investigated relationships between gut microbiome composition across infancy and temperament at 12 months of age. In 67 infants, we examined if gut microbiome composition assessed at 1-3 weeks, 2, 6, and 12 months of age was associated with temperament at age 12 months. Stool samples were sequenced using the 16S Illumina MiSeq platform. Temperament was assessed using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R). Beta diversity at age 1-3 weeks was associated with surgency/extraversion at age 12 months. Bifidobacterium and Lachnospiraceae abundance at 1-3 weeks of age was positively associated with surgency/extraversion at age 12 months. Klebsiella abundance at 1-3 weeks was negatively associated with surgency/extraversion at 12 months. Concurrent composition was associated with negative affectivity at 12 months, including a positive association with Ruminococcus-1 and a negative association with Lactobacillus. Our findings support a relationship between gut microbiome composition and infant temperament. While exploratory due to the small sample size, these results point to early and late infancy as sensitive periods during which the gut microbiome may exert effects on neurodevelopment.","","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 15:20:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article; Early Access","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-gut-brain axis; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using culture-independent DNA-based molecular techniques, the aim of the present study was to characterize, differentiate, and compare the composition of lower airway bacterial microbiome between clinically stable and acutely infected patients with bronchiectasis experiencing exacerbation. Methods Patients with clinically stable bronchiectasis and those experiencing acutely exacerbated bronchiectasis were recruited. All patients underwent bronchoscopy. Paired sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected for microbiological tests. Molecular analysis was performed for BAL samples using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing. Results The mean age of the 14 recruited patients was 60 years (range 42 to 78 years), and nine (64%) were female. Using quantitative culture and 16S rRNA sequencing, the common organisms identified from 14 BAL samples were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis, and Prevotella. Molecular techniques revealed Prevotella and Veillonella as potentially pathogenic anaerobic species. 16S rRNA gene sequencing yielded similar relative abundances and distributions of taxa in the stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis groups. Alpha diversity with richness, Simpson's and Shannon indices, and beta diversity using principal coordinate analysis revealed no significant differences in lung microbiome between patients with clinically stable and exacerbated bronchiectasis. Conclusion Culture-based microbiological and molecular-based techniques did not reveal significant differences in the lung microbiome of patients who were clinically stable and those experiencing exacerbated bronchiectasis. Patient-specific microbial communities were dominated by one or several genera, regardless of clinical status.

While we have witnessed over the last several years a resurgence of interest in fermented foods, no study has specifically explored the effects of their consumption on gut microbiota in large cohorts. To assess whether the consumption of fermented foods is associated with a systematic signal in the gut microbiome and metabolome, we used a multi-omic approach (16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and untargeted mass spectrometry) to analyze stool samples from 6,811 individuals from the American Gut Project, including 115 individuals specifically recruited for their frequency of fermented food consumption for a targeted 4-week longitudinal study. We observed subtle but statistically significant differences between consumers and nonconsumers in beta diversity as well as differential taxa between the two groups. We found that the metabolome of fermented food consumers was enriched with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a putatively health-promoting molecule. Cross-omic analyses between metagenomic sequencing and mass spectrometry suggest that CLA may be driven by taxa associated with fermented food consumers. Collectively, we found modest yet persistent signatures associated with fermented food consumption that appear present in multiple-omic types which motivate further investigation of how different types of fermented food impact the gut microbiome and overall health. IMPORTANCE Public interest in the effects of fermented food on the human gut microbiome is high, but limited studies have explored the association between fermented food consumption and the gut microbiome in large cohorts. Here, we used a combination of omics-based analyses to study the relationship between the microbiome and fermented food consumption in thousands of people using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. We found that fermented food consumers have subtle differences in their gut microbiota structure, which is enriched in conjugated linoleic acid, thought to be beneficial. The results suggest that further studies of specific kinds of fermented food and their impacts on the microbiome and health will be useful.","2020-04","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 17:49:55","","","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-fermentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The epiphytic planctomycetal communities showed a significant association with the host macroalgal species independently of the geographical location and the season. This pattern was confirmed by clone libraries of winter and summer samples: we obtained 720 16S rRNA gene sequences that represented 44 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the phylum Planctomycetes. Most of the OTUs belonged to Blastopirellula, followed by Rhodopirellula, Planctomyces, the Pir4 lineage and the uncultured class OM190 (this last one nearly 30% of the OTUs). Ulva sp. and C. crispus had more diverse planctomycetal communities than F. spiralis. Analysis of beta diversity showed that the planctomycetal microbiome was host specific. We hypothesize that the specific association of Planctomycetes and their macroalgal hosts is likely determined by nutritional molecules provided by the algae and the set of sulfatases inherent to each Planctomycetes species.","2017-03","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 17:34:45","","","","3","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-algae","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies demonstrated that breastfed infants have a different gut bacterial composition relative to formula-fed infants. In addition, animal models have shown that human milk (HM)-fed piglets had a distinct intestinal bacterial composition compared with milk formula (MF)-fed piglets. However, the gut fungal composition and the interactions with the bacterial community in breastfed compared with formula-fed infants remain to be investigated. In an attempt to evaluate such differences, we used an animal model to perform a shotgun metagenomics analysis on the cecal and distal colon contents of neonatal piglets fed with pasteurized HM or a dairy-based infant formula (MF) during the first 21 days of life. At postnatal day 21 (PND 21), a subset of piglets from each diet group (n = 11 per group) was euthanized. The remaining piglets in each group were weaned to a solid diet and euthanized at PND 51 (n = 13 per group). Large intestine contents (i.e., cecum and distal colon) were subjected to shotgun metagenomics analysis. The differential taxonomic composition of bacteria and fungi and the predicted functional gene profiling were evaluated. Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria are the most abundant bacterial phyla observed in piglets at PND 21 and PND 51. In the large intestine at PND 21 and PND 51, Proteobacteria phylum was significantly higher in MF-fed group, and species Burkholderiales bacterium of phyla was significantly higher in MF group relative to HM group. In addition, in HM group, several Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp. were higher relative to MF group in the large intestine at PND 21 and PND 51. Fungal genus Aspergillus was higher in MF, whereas Malassezia was lower relative to HM group. Persistent effects of the neonatal diets were observed at PND 51, where alpha- and beta-diversity differences were detected for bacterial and fungal species in the large intestine. Overall, our findings indicate that neonatal diet affects the large intestinal microbial community during the exclusive milk-feeding period, as well as after the introduction of the complementary food.","2022-03-23","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-18 21:45:12","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; biome-human milk; fungi sequencing; shotgun sequencing; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cancer-free controls were matched 1:1 by age (+/- 5 years), race, gender, and BMI (+/- 5 kg/m(2)). All participants provided faecal samples; isolated bacterial DNA were PCR amplified at the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and analysed using the QIIME pipeline. Tests compared cases versus controls, then separately by gender. Microbial alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were assessed, and relative abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) were compared at the genus level, with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. 22 overweight and obese cancer patients were matched with 22 cancer-free controls, with an average BMI of 30.5 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), age 54.4 +/- 5.3 years, and 54.5% were black. Fourteen matches were made between breast cancer cases and healthy female controls, and 8 matches were made with prostate cancer cases and healthy male controls. Comparison of all cases and controls revealed no differences in alpha diversity, though prostate cancer patients had higher Chaol (P=0.006) and Observed Species (P=0.036) than cancer-free males. Beta-diversity metrics were significantly different between cases and controls (P < 0.03 for all tests in whole sample and in men), though only unweighted Unifrac was different in women (P=0.005). Kruskal Wallis tests indicated significant differences among 16 genera in all matches, 9 in female, and 51 in male.

Although the upper airway microbiome is the source of the lung microbiome, the relationships between the oral, nasal, and sputum microbiota are incompletely understood. Our objective was to determine features that differentiate the oral, nasal, and sputum microbiome among subjects with stable COPD. Methods We recruited 15 current or former smokers to provide oral and sputum samples on day 1. On day 2, another oral sample and a nasal sample were obtained. Each sample and control underwent DNA extraction, 16S V4 rRNA amplification, 16S V4 sequencing, and qPCR of 16S rRNA. Data were analyzed using dada2 and R. Results Most (14 of 15) subjects were male with a mean age of 65.2. One subject had no pulmonary obstruction, while 5 had mild COPD, 7 had moderate COPD, and 2 had severe COPD. Three subjects (20%) were current tobacco users and 2 subjects (13%) used inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Subjects had a mean of 49.1 pack-years of tobacco exposure. Bacterial biomass was associated with anatomic site, but no differences in biomass were observed with age, FEV1 percent predicted (FEV1pp), ICS use, smoking status, or edentulous state. Shannon index was associated with site (lower nasal diversity than oral and sputum diversity, p<0.001), but not age, ICS use, FEV1pp, tobacco use, or edentulous state. (3-diversity was illustrated by principal coordinate analysis using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and PERMA-NOVA analyses, showing sample clustering by anatomic site (p = 0.001) with nasal samples forming a cluster separate from the combined oral wash samples and sputum samples. Clustering was also observed with ICS use (p = 0.029) and edentulous state (p = 0.019), while FEV1pp and current tobacco use were not significant. In an amplicon sequencing variant (ASV)-level analysis of oral samples using a linear regression model with Benjamini-Hochberg correction at an FDR<0.10, 10 ASVs were associated with age while no ASVs were associated with FEV1pp or smoking status. Sputum sample analysis demonstrated that 51 ASVs (25 unique genera) were associated with age, 61 ASVs (32 genera) were associated with FEV1pp, and no ASVs were associated with smoking status. In a combined dataset, the frequent exacerbator phenotype, rather than ICS use, was associated with decreased sputum Shannon diversity. Conclusions Among the upper airway microbiota of COPD subjects, anatomic site was associated with bacterial biomass, Shannon diversity, and beta-diversity. ICS use and edentulous state were both associated with beta-diversity. Age was associated with taxa relative abundance in oral and sputum samples, while FEV1pp was associated with taxa relative abundance in sputum samples only.","2019-07-23","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-06-30 16:59:53","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unique gut microbiome profiles and relation to dietary quality may underlie health disparities. Objectives To examine the dietary quality of an underrepresented group of Caribbean Latino older adults with high prevalence of chronic disease; characterize gut microbiome profiles in this cohort; determine associations between dietary quality, gut microbiome composition, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production; examine associations of clinical factors (body mass index, type 2 diabetes [T2D] status, and laxative use) with gut microbiome composition. Design The study design was cross-sectional. Participants/setting Recruitment and interviews occurred at the Senior Center in Lawrence, MA, from September 2016-September 2017. A total of 20 adults aged >= 50 years, self-identified of Caribbean Latino origin, without use of antibiotics in 6 months or intestinal surgery were included in the study. Exposure and outcome measures Diet was assessed by two, 24-hour recalls and dietary quality was calculated using the Healthy Eating Index 2015 and the Mediterranean Diet Score. The gut microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing and fecal SCFA content. Anthropometrics (ie, weight and height) were measured by a trained interviewer, and self-reported laxative use, and other self-report health outcomes (ie, T2D status) were assessed by questionnaire. Statistical analyses Faith Phylogenetic Diversity (alpha diversity) and unique fraction metric, or UniFrac (beta diversity) and nonphylogenetic metrics, including Shannon diversity index (alpha diversity) were calculated. Spearman correlations and group comparisons using Kruskal-Wallis test between alpha diversity indexes and nutrient intakes were calculated. Patterns in the microbiome were estimated using a partitioning around medoids with estimation of number of clusters, with optimum average silhouette width. Log odds were calculated to compare predefined nutrients and diet score components between microbiome clusters using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for age and sex. Pearson correlation was used to relate SCFA fecal content to individual nutrients and diet indexes. Final models were additionally adjusted for laxative use. Differences in lifestyle factors by gut microbiome cluster were tested by Fisher's exact test. Results Generally, there was poor alignment of participant's diets to either the Mediterranean Diet score or Healthy Eating Index 2015. Range in the Healthy Eating Index 2015 was 36 to 90, where only 5% (n=1) of the sample showed high adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Mediterranean Diet scores suggested low conformance with a Mediterranean eating pattern (score range=2 to 8, where 45% scored <= 3 [poor adherence]). The gut microbiome separated into two clusters by difference in a single bacterial taxon: Prevotella copri (P copri) (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA] R-2=0.576, ADONIS function P=0.001). Significantly lower P copri abundance was observed in cluster 1 compared with cluster 2 (Mann-Whitney P<0.0001). Samples in the P copri dominated cluster 2 showed significantly lower alpha diversity compared with P copri depleted cluster 1 (Shannon diversity index P=0.01). Individuals in the P copri dominated cluster showed a trend toward higher 18:3 alpha-linolenic fatty acid intakes (P=0.09). Percentage of energy from total fat intake was significantly, positively correlated with fecal acetate (r=0.46; P=0.04), butyrate (r=0.50; P=0.03) and propionate (r=0.52; P=0.02). Associations between dietary intake and composition of the gut microbiome were attenuated by self-report recent laxative use. Individuals with T2D exhibited a significantly greater abundance of the Enterobacteriales (P=0.01) and a trend toward lower fecal content of butyric acid compared to subjects without T2D (P=0.08). Significant beta diversity differences were observed by weight (Mantel P<0.003) and body mass index (Mantel P<0.07). Conclusions Two unique microbiome profiles, identified by abundance of P copri, were identified among Caribbean Latino adults. Microbiome profiles and SCFA content were associated with diet, T2D, and lifestyle. Further research is needed to determine the role of P copri and SCFA production in the risk for chronic disease and associated lifestyle predictors.","2020-12","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 14:46:50","","2047+","","12","120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-age; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imbalance in oral and gut microbiome composition and associated gene expression has been linked to different forms of hematological (blood) cancers. Our objective is to compare oral microbiome profiles of patients with blood cancers (BC group: N = 39 patients, n = 124 oral samples) to those of healthy control subjects (HC group: N = 27 subjects, n = 100 oral samples). Saliva samples and swabs of buccal mucosa, supragingival plaque, and tongue were collected from blood cancer patients and healthy controls. Next-generation sequencing (16S-rRNA gene V3-V4 region) was used to determine the relative abundance of bacterial taxa present at the genus and species levels. Differences in oral microbiome beta-diversity were determined using multivariate permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis was performed to identify differentiating bacterial taxa in pairwise comparisons. The PATRIC(v3.6.7) online tool was used to determine the predominance of potential pathogenicity in the BC group. The oral microbiome beta-diversities of the BC and HC groups differed and corresponded to a reduced alpha-diversity in the BC group. LEfSe analysis showed significant LDA scores for Actinomyces and Rothia spp., differentiating the BC group from the HC group. In silico analysis using PATRIC(v3.6.7) demonstrated that the groups of bacteria possessing traits of “antibiotic resistance”, “oral pathogen”, and “virulence” was enriched in the BC group. Although 56% of the BC patients received antibiotics within two weeks of the oral bacterial sampling, Actinomyces genus remained the top differentiating feature in the BC group regardless of the administration of antibiotics, while Rothia dentocariosa was detected as the top differentiating feature in the BC patients who did not receive antibiotics, but not in those who received antibiotics. Further investigation is needed to better understand the interactions of certain oral species with the host immune system to better characterize clinically relevant associations with hematological cancers.","2020-12","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 15:27:31","","","","12","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: In this study we hypothesized that horses affected by either Culicoides hypersensitivity or severe equine asthma or both show a decreased diversity of their intestinal microbiota. We also investigated environmental effects. Methods: Rectal swab samples of a total of 140 horses were collected and the owners completed a detailed questionnaire about their horse. For each allergic horse, a healthy peer from the same stable was equally sampled as an environmentally matched control. Microbiota in the swabs was determined by assessing the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Structures of bacterial communities were investigated by means of alpha and beta diversity indices. Results: Group wise comparisons between healthy and allergic horses showed no significant differences regarding alpha (p = 0.9) and beta diversity (p = 0.5). However, the microbial structure was associated with environmental factors such as the type of stable (p = 0.001), access to pasture (p = 0.001) or the type of feeding (p = 0.003). There was also a strong location effect meaning that the microbiota was more similar within the same as compared between farms within this study. Conclusion: Our observations suggest that hypersensitivity disorders in adult horses are not associated with an alteration of the intestinal microbiota, but environmental and/or location factors strongly influence these bacteria.","2020-01-01","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-18 21:56:38","","97-107","","1","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; var-allergies; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fishery industry faces a similar dilemma, disposing of nearly 50% of fish processed for human consumption. Economically feasible and science-based alternatives are needed to overcome this problem. One possible solution is to add value to the remaining nutrients from these by-products. This study focuses on the breakdown of nutrients in controlled fermentations of Aw, fish waste (F), molasses (M), and a lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strain (Lr). The aim was to assess the dynamic variations in microbial diversity and the biochemical changes that occur during fermentation. Four treatments were compared (AwF, AwFM, AwFLr, and AwFMLr), and the fermentation lasted 14 days at 22.5 degrees C. Samples were taken every other day. Colorimetric tests for peptide concentrations, pH, and microbial ecology by 16S-v4 rRNA amplicon using Illumina MiSeq were conducted. The results of the microbial ecology showed elevated levels of alpha and beta diversity in the samples at day zero. By day 2 of fermentation, pH dropped, and the availability of a different set of nutrients was reflected in the microbial diversity. The fermentation started to stabilize and was driven by the Firmicutes phylum, which dominated the microbial community by day 14. Moreover, there was a significant increase (3.6 times) in peptides when comparing day 0 with day 14, making this treatment practical and feasible for protein hydrolysis. This study valorizes two nutrient-dense by-products and provides an alternative to the current handling of these materials.","2021-01","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-06-30 18:11:36","","","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-fermentation; var-longitudinal; var-pH","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to characterize cervical microbiome feature of reproductive-age women in the progression of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) to cervical cancer. Methods. We characterized the 16S rDNA cervical mucus microbiome in 94 participants (age from 18 to 52), including 13 cervical cancer (CA), 31 high-grade SIL (HSIL), 10 low-grade SIL (LSIL), 12 HPV-infected (NH) patients and 28 healthy controls (NN). Alpha (within sample) diversity was examined by Shannon and Simpson index, while Beta (between sample) diversity by principle coordinate analysis (PCoA) of weighted Unifrac distances. Relative abundance of microbial taxa was compared using Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe). Co-occurrence analysis was performed to identify correlation among marker genera, and Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) to explore functional features and pathways of cervical microbiota. Results. Alpha diversity(p < 0.05) was higher in severer cervical pathology with lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus as well as higher of anaerobes. Beta diversity (p < 0.01) was significantly different. Marker genera were identified including Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Campylobacter of CA and Sneathia of HSIL. The correlation of differential functional pathways with Prevotella was opposite to that with Lactobacillus. Conclusion. Our study suggests differences in cervical microbiota diversity and relative abundance of reproductive-age females in different stages of cervical carcinogenesis. Marker genera might participate in the lesion progression and will be helpful for diagnosis, prevention and treatment. These findings may lead the way to further study of the cervical microbiome in development of cervical cancer. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, it is of interest to study immigrants living in a western environment as well as their counterparts in the country of origin to understand differences in their microbiomes and health status. Methods: We investigated 58 Australian Chinese (AC) children from Perth, Western Australia as well as 63 Chinese-born Chinese (CC) children from a city in China. Oropharyngeal (OP) and fecal samples were collected. To assess the microbiomes, 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing for variable regions V3 and V4 was used. Skin prick tests (SPT) were performed to measure the children's atopic status. Information on food allergy and wheezing were acquired from a questionnaire. Results: AC children had more allergic conditions than CC children. The alpha diversity (mean species diversity) of both OP and gut microbiome was lower in AC children compared to CC children for richness estimate (Chao1), while diversity evenness (Shannon index) was higher. The beta diversity (community similarity) displayed a distinct separation of the OP and gut microbiota between AC and CC children. An apparent difference in microbial abundance was observed for many bacteria. In AC children, we sought to establish consistent trends in bacterial relative abundance that are either higher or lower in AC versus CC children and higher or lower in children with allergy versus those without allergy. The majority of OP taxa showed a consistent trend while the majority of fecal taxa showed a contrasting trend. Conclusion: Distinct differences in microbiome compositions were found in both oropharyngeal and fecal samples of AC and CC children. The association of the OP microbiome with allergic condition is different from that of the gut microbiome in AC children. The microbiome profiles are changed by the western environment/lifestyle and are associated with allergies in Chinese immigrant children in Australia.","2019-08","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-07-19 17:08:50","","","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-allergies; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this study was to characterize how soil bacterial communities vary across diurnal, sub-seasonal and seasonal time-scales in a 5.8 m(2) plot and test the hypothesis that bacterial diversity varies on each of these scales. We used 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing to quantify the alpha and beta diversity of soil bacteria as well as the Net Relatedness Index and Nearest Taxon Indices to assess the degree of phylogenetic clustering, and the extent to which community shifts were driven by stochastic vs. deterministic limitation. We found that species richness was highest in winter, lowest in fall and that communities were compositionally distinct across seasons. There was no evidence of diurnal-scale shifts; the finest temporal scale over which community shifts were detected using our DNA-based analysis was between sampling dates separated by 6 weeks. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that seasonal-scale differences in community composition were the result of environmental filtering and homogeneous selection. Our findings provide insight into temporal variation of soil bacterial communities across the hourly to seasonal scales while minimizing the potential confounding effect of spatial variation. Soil bacterial communities are distinct across the four seasons and at the sub-seasonal scale, but not the dirunal-scale, in a temperate deciduous forest.","2019-02","2022-06-27 16:29:00","2022-06-29 17:18:42","","","","2","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Site topography, soil physical and chemical attributes, and soil/root-associated microbial composition can contribute to this phenomenon. In order to better understand the microbial dynamics associated with each site type (H/L), we collected bulk soil (BS), rhizosphere soil (RS), and soybean root (R) samples from historically high and low yield sites across eight Pennsylvania farms at V1 (first trifoliate) and R8 (maturity) soybean growth stages (SGS). We extracted DNA extracted from collected samples and performed high-throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons from both the fungal ITS and prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene regions. Sequences were then grouped into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and subjected to network analysis. Based on both ITS and 16S rRNA gene data, a greater network size and edges were observed for all sample types from H-sites compared to L-sites at both SGS. Network analysis suggested that the number of potential microbial interactions/associations were greater in samples from H-sites compared to L-sites. Diversity analyses indicated that site-type was not a main driver of alpha and beta diversity in soybean-associated microbial communities. L-sites contained a greater percentage of fungal phytopathogens (ex: Fusarium, Macrophomina, Septoria), while H-sites contained a greater percentage of mycoparasitic (ex: Trichoderma) and entomopathogenic (ex: Metarhizium) fungal genera.

Cloacal swabs, due to their proximity to the ceca (a vital site of functional activity), are an alternative, non-invasive method used for assaying microbial communities and might be a viable option for longitudinal studies. In this study, the microbiota of twenty paired cecal content and cloacal swab samples representing two dietary treatments was assessed using 16S rRNA V4 hypervariable region sequencing and was analyzed using the MOTHUR pipeline, Phyloseq, and Vegan packages. Paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed significant differences in the Chao1 index (p-value <0.0001 and p-value <0.0001, respectively) but not in the Inverse Simpson species diversity estimator (p-value = 0.06763 and p-value = 0.06021, respectively) between the cecal content and cloacal swabs. beta-diversity between the cloacal swabs and cecal microbiota also showed significant differences using PERMANOVA, HOMOVA, and weighted UniFrac testing (p-values < 0.001). Based on a paired sample analysis, this study provided evidence of the high inter-individual variation and randomness of cloacal microbiota, in contrast to cecal microbiota. Our findings indicated that cloacal swabs do not approximate the alpha or beta diversity of cecal samples and are not suitable for longitudinal studies of gut microbiota.","2020-05","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-29 17:12:08","","","","5","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, minor variations in physicochemical properties; TOC, sodium, chloride, zinc and nitrate were observed, including the pH of the spring openings. Illumina based amplicon sequencing revealed Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi as the major bacterial phylum with higher abundance in the DJ04 sample. The alpha diversity of all the springs was almost same, whereas beta diversity revealed variations in the degree of uniqueness of OTUs at different temperatures.

The major hydrocarbon family genes and Carbohydrate Active Enzyme pathways were predicted to be highest in DJ04 with elevated concentrations of HCO3 and TOC. Higher homogeneity in geo-physicochemical and microbial features direct the possibility of the common origin of these springs through plumbing systems. However, the minor variations in diversity and functionality were due to variations in temperature in spring openings through the mixing of subsurface water contaminated with carbohydrates from leaf biomass litter. Functional characterization of the thermophilic bacteria of this spring provides essential scope for further industrial applications. The biogeochemical reasons hypothesized for the genesis of unique multiple openings in the cluster are also of interest to conservation scientists for taking measures toward necessary laws and regulations to protect and preserve these springs.","2021-11-25","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-07-19 19:25:21","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fecal samples were collected immediately before treatment and 5 days after treatment for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The prespecified outcome was a-diversity (inverse Simpson's alpha-diversity index), with secondary outcomes of beta and gamma Simpson's and Shannon's diversities. Results. At 5 days after treatment, 40 children aged 1-60 months were analyzed in the azithromycin-treated group and 40 children in the placebo-treated group.

Although much of the research has focused on cognitive, motor and psychiatric symptoms, the extent of peripheral pathology and the relationship between these factors, and the core symptoms of Huntington's disease, are relatively unknown. Gut microbiota are key modulators of communication between the brain and gut, and alterations in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) can negatively affect cognition, behaviour and affective function, and may be implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis was recently reported in Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Our main objective was to characterize the gut microbiome in people with Huntington's disease and determine whether the composition of gut microbiota are significantly related to clinical indicators of disease progression. We compared 42 Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers, including 19 people who were diagnosed with Huntington's disease (Total Functional Capacity > 6) and 23 in the premanifest stage, with 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants were characterized clinically using a battery of cognitive tests and using results from 16S V3 to V4 rRNA sequencing of faecal samples to characterize the gut microbiome. For gut microbiome measures, we found significant differences in the microbial communities (beta diversity) based on unweighted UniFrac distance (P = 0.001), as well as significantly lower alpha diversity (species richness and evenness) between our combined Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group and healthy controls (P = 0.001). We also found major shifts in the microbial community structure at Phylum and Family levels, and identified functional pathways and enzymes affected in our Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group. Within the Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group, we also discovered associations among gut bacteria, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest an altered gut microbiome in Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers.

We hypothesized that the rumen microbiome is established at or near birth and is subject to maternal influences that can influence preruminant and postruminant microbial profiles. Our objective was to determine how mode of delivery and rearing affected the development of the rumen microbiome. Bred mature Charolais cows were randomly allocated to one of the three treatment groups: control (CON; n = 8), bottle reared (BOT; n = 8), and caesarian section (CSET; n = 8), where CON was vaginal birth and raised by their dam; BOT was vaginal birth, then removed 24-h post-parturition, and raised on commercial milk replacer; and CSET was born via caesarian section and raised by their respective dams. Calf rumen fluid was collected from calves at 1, 3, and 28 d of age via oral lavage and metagenomic shotgun sequencing was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. Sequence data were analyzed utilizing Metataxa2 for taxonomic assignment followed by QIIME to determine alpha- and beta-diversity differences. A total of 1,113 taxa had differential abundance when comparing day while 66 taxa had differential abundance across treatment groups. There were no differences across treatment group richness (P > 0.05), but day 28 was significantly more rich (P = 0.003) compared with days 1 and 3 with no difference between days 1 and 3 (P = 0.58). No differences in 3-diversity were detected across treatment group with the exception of greater variance in the BOT and CSET compared with the CON (P = 0.048). Microbial profiles of day 1 are more similar to each other than day 3 or 28 (P = 0.03); day 3 is more similar to each other than day 1 or 28 (P = 0.03); and day 28 is more similar to each other than day 1 or 3 (P = 0.03). These data suggest that while treatment group did not have a large impact on microbial diversity, several specific taxa were affected by treatment group. Day affects the microbial diversity both within and among samples. Understanding how these profiles shift with age is critical to understanding key intervention periods for optimal alteration of the microbiome.","2018-09","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-07-19 17:57:11","","S96","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-cattle rumen; shotgun sequencing; var-birth mode; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C57Bl/6 female mice were fed three different vitamin D-containing diets for 24 days before half of the mice in each group were UV-irradiated (1 kJ/m(2)) for each of four days, followed by twice-weekly irradiation of shaved dorsal skin for 35 days. Faecal DNA was extracted and high-throughput sequencing of the 16S RNA gene performed. UV irradiation of skin was associated with a significant change in the beta-diversity of faeces compared to nonirradiated mice, independently of vitamin D. Specifically, members of phylum Firmicutes, including Coprococcus, were enriched, whereas members of phylum Bacteroidetes, such as Bacteroidales, were depleted. Expression of colonic CYP27B1 increased by four-fold and IL1 decreased by five-fold, suggesting a UVR-induced anti-inflammatory effect. UV-irradiated mice, however, were not protected against colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), although distinct faecal microbiome differences were documented post-DSS between UV-irradiated and nonirradiated mice. Thus, skin exposure to UVR alters the faecal microbiome, and further investigations to explore the implications of this in health and disease are warranted.","2018-08","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-07-19 17:15:53","","","","8","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chickens, which become colonized on the farm, are important reservoirs of this bacterium. Campylobacter can establish itself in the broiler house via a variety of sources, can survive in the litter of the house, and possibly persist over successive flock cycles. However, the role of the broiler litter microbiome on Campylobacter persistence is not clear. A matched case-control study was conducted to determine whether the broiler litter microbiome composition was associated with Campylobacter isolation within the broiler house. Flocks were classified as cases when either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli was isolated in boot sock samples, or as controls otherwise. Case and control flocks were matched at the broiler house level. Composite broiler litter samples were collected and used for DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene V4 region sequencing. Reads were processed using the DADA2 pipeline to obtain a table of amplicon sequence variants. Alpha diversity and differential bacterial relative abundance were used as predictors of Campylobacter isolation status in conditional logistic regression models adjusting for flock age and sampling season. Beta diversity distances were used as regressors in stratified PERMANOVA with Campylobacter isolation status as predictor, and broiler house as stratum. When Campylobacter was isolated in boot socks, broiler litter microbiome richness and evenness were lower and higher, respectively, without reaching statistical significance. Campylobacter isolation status significantly explained a small proportion of the beta diversity (genus-level Aitchison dissimilarity distance). Clostridium and Anaerostipes were positively associated with Campylobacter isolation status, whereas Bifidobacterium, Anaerosporobacter, and Stenotrophomonas were negatively associated. Our results suggest the presence of bacterial interactions between Campylobacter and the broiler litter microbiome. The negative association of Campylobacter with Bifidobacterium, Anaerosporobacter, and Stenotrophomonas in litter could be potentially exploited as a pre-harvest control strategy.","2021-05-24","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-30 19:36:49","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry litter; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soils were inoculated with three differentE.coliO157 strains (stx1+/stx2+,stx1-/stx2-,and stx1-/stx2+), and enumerated until extinction at 30 degrees C. There was a significant difference in the survival ofE.coliO157 based on soil treatment (autoclaved versus natural) at 30 degrees C on days 1 (P= 0.00022), 3, (P= 2.53e-14), 7 (P= 5.59e-16), 14 (P= 1.072e-12), 30 (P= 7.18e-9), and 56 (P= 0.00029), with greater survival in autoclaved soils.

A separateE.coliO157 trial supplemented with 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the soil microbiome was performed at 15 degrees C and 30 degrees C on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 for each soil treatment. Greater species richness (Chao1,P= 2.2e-16) and diversity (Shannon,P= 2.2e-16) was observed in natural soils in comparison with autoclaved soils. Weighted UniFrac (beta-diversity) showed a clear distinction between soil treatments (P= 0.001).

However, little is known about the establishment of microbial communities in the calf GIT or their dynamics during development. In this study, next-generation sequencing was used to assess changes in the bacterial communities of the rumen, jejunum, cecum, and colon in 26 crossbred calves at four developmental stages (7, 28, 49, and 63 days old). Alpha diversity differed among GIT regions with the lowest diversity and evenness in the jejunum, whereas no changes in alpha diversity were observed across developmental stage. Beta diversity analysis showed both region and age effects, with low numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared between regions within a given age group or between ages in a given region. Taxonomic analysis revealed that several taxa coexisted in the rumen, jejunum, cecum, and colon but that their abundances differed considerably by GIT region and age. As calves aged, we observed lower abundances of taxa such as Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Paraprevotella with higher abundances of Bulleidia and Succiniclasticum in the rumen. The jejunum also displayed taxonomic changes with increases in Clostridiaceae and Turicibacter taxa in older calves. In the lower gut, taxa such as Lactobacillus, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium decreased and S24-7, Paraprevotella, and Prevotella increased as calves aged. These data support a model whereby early and successive colonization by bacteria occurs across the GIT of calves and provides insights into the temporal dynamics of the GIT microbiota of dairy calves during preweaning development. IMPORTANCE The gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) of ruminants, such as dairy cows, house complex microbial communities that contribute to their overall health and support their ability to produce milk. For example, the rumen microbiota converts feed into usable nutrients, while the jejunal microbiota provides access to protein. Thus, establishing a properly functioning GIT microbiota in dairy calves is critical to their productivity as adult cows. However, little is known about the establishment, maintenance, and dynamics of the calf GIT microbiota in early life. In this study, we evaluated the bacterial communities in the rumen, jejunum, cecum, and colon in dairy calves across preweaning development and show that they are highly variable early on in life before transitioning to a stable community. Understanding the dairy calf GIT microbiota has implications for ensuring proper health during early life and will aid in efforts to develop strategies for improving downstream production.","2018-05","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-07-01 16:16:46","","","","9","84","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle rumen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amplicon sequencing of multiple conserved, phylogenetically informative loci has therefore become an instrumental tool for many researchers. Investigations in many systems are hindered, however, since essential sequencing depth can be lost by amplification of nontarget DNA from hosts or overabundant microorganisms. Here, we introduce “blocking oligos”, a low-cost and flexible method using standard oligonucleotides to block amplification of diverse nontargets and software to aid their design. We apply them primarily in leaves, where exceptional challenges with host amplification prevail. A. thaliana-specific blocking oligos applied in eight different target loci reduce undesirable host amplification by up to 90%. To expand applicability, we designed universal 16S and 18S rRNA gene plant blocking oligos for targets that are conserved in diverse plant species and demonstrate that they efficiently block five plant species from five orders spanning monocots and dicots (Bromus erectus, Plantago lanceolata, Lotus corniculatus, Amaranth sp., Arabidopsis thaliana). These can increase alpha diversity discovery without biasing beta diversity patterns and do not compromise microbial load information inherent to plant-derived 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data. Finally, we designed and tested blocking oligos to avoid amplification of 18S rRNA genes of a sporulating oomycete pathogen, demonstrating their effectiveness in applications well beyond plants. Using these tools, we generated a survey of the A. thaliana leaf microbiome based on eight loci targeting bacterial, fungal, oomycete and other eukaryotic microorganisms and discuss complementarity of commonly used amplicon sequencing regions for describing leaf microbiota. This approach has potential to make questions in a variety of study systems more tractable by making amplicon sequencing more targeted, leading to deeper, systems-based insights into microbial discovery. For fast and easy design for blocking oligos for any nontarget DNA in other study systems, we developed a publicly available R package.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-30 17:07:14","","1952-1965","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pregnant women, who develop gestational diabetes (GDM), have a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. In the present study we assessed whether GDM is linked to variation in the oral microbial community by examining the diversity and composition of the salivary microbiota.MethodIn this observational study the salivary microbiota of pregnant women with GDM (n=50) and normal glucose regulation (n=160) in third trimester and 9 months postpartum was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the V1-V3 region. GDM was diagnosed in accordance with the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. Cross-sectional difference in alpha diversity was assessed using Student's t-test and longitudinal changes were assessed by mixed linear regression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal difference in beta diversity was assessed by permutational multivariate analyses of variance. Differentially abundant genera and OTUs were identified by negative binomial regression.ResultsIn the third trimester, two species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), while eight OTUs postpartum were differentially abundant in women with GDM compared with normoglycaemic women. OTU richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou evenness decreased from late pregnancy to 9 months after delivery regardless of glycaemic status.ConclusionGDM is associated with a minor aberration of the salivary microbiota during late pregnancy and postpartum. For unknown reasons richness of the salivary microbiota decreased from late pregnancy to postpartum, which might be explained by the physiological changes of the immune system during human pregnancy.","2020-01-31","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-07-19 19:26:14","","","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few studies, however, have considered the microbial ecology of such biological invasions. In this study, we investigated the gut microbiota of invasive small Indian mongooses in terms of taxonomic diversity and functional potential. To this end, we collected fecal samples from 60 free-roaming mongooses trapped in different vegetation zones on the island Saint Kitts. The core gut microbiome, assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing on the Ion S5(TM) XL platform, reflects a carnivore-like signature with a dominant abundance of Firmicutes (54.96%), followed by Proteobacteria (13.98%) and Fusobacteria (12.39%), and a relatively minor contribution of Actinobacteria (10.4%) and Bacteroidetes (6.40%). Mongooses trapped at coastal sites exhibited a higher relative abundance of Fusobacterium spp. whereas those trapped in scrubland areas were enriched in Bacteroidetes, but there was no site-specific difference in predicted metabolic properties. Between males and females, beta-diversity was not significantly different and no sex-specific strategies for energy production were observed. However, the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, and more specifically, Enterobacteriaceae, was significantly higher in males. This first description of the microbial profile of small Indian mongooses provides new insights into their bioecology and can serve as a springboard to further elucidating this invasive predator's impact throughout the Caribbean.","2021-03","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-30 19:50:30","","","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-mongoose gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, dietary impacts on the gut microbiome are lacking, especially under varying environmental conditions. To examine this response, post-smolt salmon (184 +/- 5 g) were fed diets with lipid:protein ratios considered low (180, 570 g/kg) and high (230, 460 g/kg) along with low and high levels of n-3 LC-PUFA (7 or 14 g/kg) while fish were reared under low and high levels of dissolved oxygen (6.7 or 8.0 mg/L). At day 0, 35 and 116, digesta in the distal intestine were collected and analyzed for viable counts and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (V4 region) using Illumina MiSeq. The reduction in oxygen had negligible effects, except on viable plate counts of total bacteria and an initial effect on beta-diversity. In contrast, the high lipid (HL) diets had an increased alpha-diversity (e.g., Shannon and Chao-1) at day 0 and day 35 whereas high n-3 diets suppressed these indices at day 116. Generally, a reduction in alpha-diversity was observed over time and an interaction between lipid:protein ratio x n-3 was found. Between diets, beta-diversity and phyla abundance were similar as both Proteobacteria (44%) and Firmicutes (21%) dominated. However, at the genus level Aliivibrio, Streptococcus, Weissella, and Lactobacillus, were associated with low lipid (LL) diets while the high lipid diets were associated with less abundant bacteria, e.g., Chromohalobacter. At day 116, the relative abundance of the Tenericutes phylum increased 10-fold (36%). Fish fed the high lipid diet with high n-3 had reduced alpha-diversity, lowest abundance of lactic acid bacteria, and highest abundance of Mycoplasma, which may indicate a less healthy gut microbiome. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis revealed that saturated and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathways were several folds higher in fish fed the high lipid diet, possibly to compensate for the lack of dietary n-3. In summary, our results show that the viable plate counts, alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and predictive function of gut bacteria in Atlantic salmon post-smolts are influenced by dietary lipid:protein ratio and n-3 LC-PUFA over several time points with little effect by dissolved oxygen.","2020-12-23","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-07-19 17:05:09","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fish gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies have shown that people with diabetes are more susceptible to oral problems, such as periodontitis and, although the causes are still inconclusive, oral microbiota is considered to play a major role in oral health. This study aimed to characterize the oral microbiome of a sample representing T2DM patients from Portugal and exploit potential associations between some microorganisms and variables like teeth brushing, smoking habits, average blood sugar levels, medication and nutrient intake. By sequencing the hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene in 50 individuals belonging to a group of diabetes patients and a control group, we found a total of 232 taxa, from which only 65% were shared between both groups. No differences were found in terms of alpha and beta diversity between categories. We did not find significant differences in the oral microbiome profiles of control and diabetes patients. Only the class Synergistia and the genus TG5, which are related to periodontitis, were statistically more frequent in the control group. The similar microbiome profiles of medicated diabetics and the control group indicates that the relationship between the T2DM and the oral microbiome might be more related to either the lifestyle/diet rather than diabetes per se. Moreover, this study provides, for the first time, insights into the oral microbiome of a population with a high prevalence of diabetes.","2021-02-05","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-29 17:14:20","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative changes of cervical microbiota in patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy and radiation treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer. Methods Cervical cytobrush samples of 15 cervical patients undergoing chemoradiation treatment were collected 1 day before starting external beam radiation therapy and on the day of the last fraction of brachytherapy. After DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region was performed on the MiSeq platform, followed by data processing and statistical analyses concerning the alpha and beta diversity of 16 samples (7 samples were excluded because of incomplete sample sets). Results The amount of amplicon yield after polymerase chain reaction analysis in post-radiation samples was significantly lower compared with the baseline samples (pre 31.49 +/- 24.07 ng/mu l; post 1.33 +/- 1.94 ng/mu l; p=0.007). A comparison of pre-treatment and post-treatment samples did not show significant differences regarding beta diversity (weighted UniFrac). There was no significant difference in alpha diversity, which is used to characterize species diversity within a particular community and takes into account both number and abundance (Shannon Diversity Index pre-treatment samples: 2.167 +/- 0.7504 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.79); post-treatment samples: 1.97 +/- 0.43 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.33); p=0.38). Interindividual differences in patients could partly explain some variation of the samples (permutational multivariate analysis of variance).

In the present study we sought to identify sensitive and specific biomarkers of changes in the oral microbiome of early stage PD through shotgun metatranscriptomic profiling. We recruited 48 PD subjects and 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Subjects completed detailed assessments of motor, cognitive, balance, autonomic and chemosensory (smell and taste) functions to determine their disease stage. We also obtained a saliva sample for profiling of microbial RNA and host mRNA using next generation sequencing. We found no differences in overall alpha and beta diversity between subject groups. However, changes in specific microbial taxa were observed, including primarily bacteria, but also yeast and phage. Nearly half of our findings were consistent with prior studies in the field obtained through profiling of fecal samples, with others representing highly novel candidates for detection of early stage PD. Testing of the diagnostic utility of the microbiome data revealed potentially robust performance with as few as 11 taxonomic features achieving a cross-validated area under the ROC curve of 0.90 and overall accuracy of 84.5%. Bioinformatic analysis of 167 different metabolic pathways supported shifts in a small set of distinct pathways involved in amino acid and energy metabolism among the organisms comprising the oral microbiome. In parallel with the microbial analysis, we also examined the evidence for changes in human salivary mRNAs in the same subjects. This revealed significant changes in a set of 9 host mRNAs, several of which mapped to various brain functions and showed correlations with some of the significantly changed microbial taxa. Unexpectedly, we also observed robust correlations between many of the microbiota and functional measures, including those reflecting cognition, balance, and disease duration. These results suggest that the oral microbiome may represent a highly-accessible and informative microenvironment that offers new insights in the pathophysiology of early stage PD.","2019-06-27","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-30 17:55:42","","","","6","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","shotgun sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (p<0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, p<0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.","2018-03-26","2022-06-27 16:29:01","2022-06-30 17:00:18","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systemic inflammatory factors have been implicated in symptomatic hand osteoarthritis (OA). Gut microbiome dysbiosis promotes systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine the association between the gut microbiome and the presence of symptomatic hand OA in a population-based study. Methods. Study participants were subjects of the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study, a community-based observational study conducted in the Hunan Province of China. Symptomatic hand OA was defined as the presence of both symptoms and radiographic OA in the same hand. The gut microbiome was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in stool samples. We examined the relation of alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, relative abundance of taxa, and potential bacterial functional pathways to symptomatic hand OA. Results. A total of 1,388 participants (mean age 61.3 years, 57.4% women) were included in the study, of whom 72 had symptomatic hand OA (prevalence of symptomatic hand OA 5.2%). Beta-diversity of the gut microbiome, but not alpha-diversity, was significantly associated with the presence of symptomatic hand OA (P = 0.003). Higher relative abundance of the genera Bilophila and Desulfovibrio as well as lower relative abundance of the genus Roseburia was associated with symptomatic hand OA. Most functional pathways (i.e., those annotated in the KEGG Ortholog hierarchy) that were observed to be altered in participants with symptomatic hand OA belonged to the amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolic pathways. Conclusion. This large, population-based study provides the first evidence that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome were observed among study participants who had symptomatic hand OA, and a low relative abundance of Roseburia but high relative abundance of Bilophila and Desulfovibrio at the genus level were associated with prevalent symptomatic hand OA.

Ovariectomized (OVX) rodent models, often combined with a high-fat diet (HFD), have been used to investigate the effects of decreased estrogen production on metabolism. Since evidence suggests that gut microbes may facilitate the protective effect of estrogen on metabolic dysregulation in an OVX + HFD model, we investigated whether the gut microbiome plays a role in the diet-independent weight gain that occurs after OVX in adult female mice. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that OVX was not associated with changes in overall gut bacterial biodiversity but was correlated with a shift in beta diversity. Using differential abundance analysis, we observed a difference in the relative abundance of a few bacterial taxa, such as Turicibacter, 3 to 5 weeks after OVX, which was subsequent to the weight gain that occurred 2 weeks postsurgery. A cohousing study was performed to determine whether exposure to a healthy gut microbiome was protective against the development of the metabolic phenotype associated with OVX. Unlike mouse models of obesity, HFD maternal-induced metabolic dysregulation, or polycystic ovary syndrome, cohousing OVX mice with healthy mice did not improve the metabolic phenotype of OVX mice. Altogether, these results indicate that changes in the gut microbiome are unlikely to play a causal role in diet-independent, OVX-induced weight gain (since they occurred after the weight gain) and cohousing with healthy mice did not have a protective effect.","2021-01","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-06-30 20:58:58","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animals were randomly distributed into four equal groups (n = 6): control, adenine, GA and adenine + GA groups. CKD was induced by adenine (0.75% w/w) given in the diet daily for four weeks, and GA was administered in drinking water at a concentration of 15% w/v. The 16s rRNA analysis was performed on Illumina Miseq targeting V3-V4 region to characterize microbial composition. The abundance of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes and Verrucomicrobia bacteria was increased in adenine-induced CKD, and GA treatment successfully reversed those levels. Interestingly, alpha and beta diversity index were both reduced with GA treatment in rats with CKD. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) measurement and PICRUSt analysis have shown that GA treatment completely restored the depleted butyrate level and various perturbated functional pathways, respectively, in CKD rats. Taking together, our results suggest that GA supplementation has a beneficial role in treating CKD, through an increased production of butyrate, as well as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant capacity and anti-nitrosative properties.","2021-01","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-06-30 17:04:18","","","","","133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence on the relationship between sugar consumption and the oral microbiome, however, remains scarce and inconclusive. We explored whether the diversity, composition, and functional capacities of saliva microbiota differ based on the consumption of select sugary foods and drinks (”sweet treats”). Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterized saliva microbiota from 11 to 13-year-old children who participated in the Finnish Health in Teens (Fin-HIT) cohort study. The sample comprised children in the lowest (n = 227) and highest (n = 226) tertiles of sweet treat consumption. We compared differences in the alpha diversity (Shannon, inverse Simpson, and Chao1 indices), beta diversity (principal coordinates analysis based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity), and abundance (differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the genus level) between these low and high consumption groups. We performed PICRUSt2 to predict the metabolic pathways of microbial communities. No differences emerged in the alpha diversity between low and high sweet treat consumption, whereas the beta diversity differed between groups (p = 0.001). The abundance of several genera such as Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella, and Selenomonas was higher in the high consumption group compared with the low consumption group following false discovery rate correction (p < 0.05). Children with high sweet treat consumption exhibited higher proportions of nitrate reduction IV and gondoate biosynthesis pathways compared with the low consumption group (p < 0.05). To conclude, sweet treat consumption shapes saliva microbiota. Children who consume a high level of sweet treats exhibited different compositions and metabolic pathways compared with children who consume low levels of sweet treats. Our findings reveal novel insights into the relationship between sugary diets and oral microbiota.","2022-04-25","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-07-19 15:18:29","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-diet; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Especially in avian taxa our understanding of the ecology and function of these bacteria remains incomplete. The involvement of skin bacteria in intra-specific communication has recently received attention, and has highlighted the need to understand what information is potentially being encoded in bacterial communities. Using next generation sequencing techniques, we characterised the skin microbiome of wild zebra finches, aiming to understand the impact of sex, age and group composition on skin bacteria communities. For this purpose, we sampled skin swabs from both sexes and two age classes (adults and nestlings) of 12 different zebra finch families and analysed the bacterial communities. Results Using 16S rRNA sequencing we found no effect of age, sex and family on bacterial diversity (alpha diversity). However, when comparing the composition (beta diversity), we found that animals of social groups (families) harbour highly similar bacterial communities on their skin with respect to community composition. Within families, closely related individuals shared significantly more bacterial taxa than non-related animals. In addition, we found that age (adults vs. nestlings) affected bacterial composition. Finally, we found that spatial proximity of nest sites, and therefore individuals, correlated with the skin microbiota similarity. Conclusions Birds harbour very diverse and complex bacterial assemblages on their skin. These bacterial communities are distinguishable and characteristic for intraspecific social groups. Our findings are indicative for a family-specific skin microbiome in wild zebra finches. Genetics and the (social) environment seem to be the influential factors shaping the complex bacterial communities.

Chronic systemic inflammation has been linked to alterations in nervous system activity and initiation of distressing symptoms, such as fatigue. Damage to gut mucosa due to alteration in gut microbiota (GM) composition and microbial translocation has been shown to increase systemic proinflammatory cytokines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between fatigue and GM by measuring the differences in GM composition in HCT survivors with and without persistent fatigue. This cross-sectional study included 30 adults who underwent HCT for a hematologic disease and were at least 1 year postHCT. Patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease were excluded. Fatigue severity was assessed by the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). Based on the BFI score, patients were grouped into 2 categories: 0 to 3 (without fatigue) and >= 4 (with fatigue). The V1 to V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from fecal specimens was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq. Sequencing reads were processed, denoised, and replicated, chimeras were filtered, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated, and taxonomy was assigned using DADA2. Beta diversity analysis through principal coordinate analysis was generated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix, and the difference was tested using linear model with generalized least squares in R. An alpha diversity analysis was performed using Chao1. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was used to find markers that differ between the 2 groups. Based on the BFI results, patients were categorized into 2 cohorts: with fatigue (n = 14) and without fatigue (n = 16). The 2 cohorts were similar in terms of demographics, disease, and transplant characteristics. Based on the GM analysis, there was a significant difference in GM composition (beta diversity) between the 2 cohorts (P = .001). Alpha diversity (richness) was also significantly lower in survivors with fatigue (P -.002). LEfSe analysis identified 46 discriminative features (P < .05; linear discriminant analysis score >2) whose relative abundance varied significantly among individuals with fatigue and those without fatigue. Ten ASVs were associated with the patients with fatigue, and 36 ASVs were associated with those without fatigue. Several ASVs enriched in survivors with fatigue included organisms such as Klebsiella and Enterococcus, which have been implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases. The ASVs enriched in the cohort without fatigue were members of the Ruminococcaceae family (Oscillospira spp) and the Lachnospiraceae family (Fusicatenibacter and Coprococcus spp), which are known to have the ability to ferment complex plant carbohydrates. These findings show an association between GM composition and fatigue and suggest a microbial contribution to clinically significant fatigue post-HCT, which may guide the development of new approaches to treating fatigue based on manipulation of the GM.

These changes, along with alterations in lifestyle, diet, nutrition, inflammation and immune function alter both composition and stability of the gut microbiota. Given the impact of environmental influences on the gut microbiota, animal models are particularly useful in this field. To understand the relationship between the gut microbiota and aging in nonhuman primates, we collected fecal samples from 20 male and 20 female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), across the natural macaque age range, for 16S rRNA gene analyses. Operational taxonomic units were then grouped together to summarize taxon abundance at different hierarchical levels of classification and alpha- and beta-diversity were calculated. There were no age or sex differences in alpha diversity. At the phylum level, relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes ratio were different between age groups though significance disappeared after correction for multiple comparisons. At the class level, relative abundance of Firmicutes_Bacilli decreased and Proteobacteria_Alphaproteobacteria and Proteobacteria_Betaproteobacteria increased with each successively older group. Only differences in Firmicutes_Bacilli remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

These shifts in microbial structure either promote beneficial effects to the host or cause diseases. Supplementation of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), the precursor of tetrapyrroles, has been previously reported to enhance shrimp's immune response. To know whether 5-ALA has effects on the gut bacterial structure in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), we investigated the bacterial communities in the intestine and stomach ofL. vannameiusing high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries. One week of 5-ALA supplementation altered the bacterial community structure (beta diversity) in both tissues, as shown by the results of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). DESeq2 analysis revealed enrichment of differentially abundant taxa in the 5-ALA group (e.g.EnhydrobacterandOceaniovalibus) and control group (e.g.TenacibaculumandMycobacterium). Metagenomic predictions suggested that the control group had more KEGG pathways associated with `metabolism' than the 5-ALA group. This study suggests that 5-ALA supplementation potentially promotes the formation of a beneficial bacterial community structure in shrimp. This is the first report on the effect of 5-ALA supplementation on the bacterial community profile in any organism.","2020-10","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-07-19 17:18:14","","4075-4086","","10","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-shrimp gut; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The association of habitual diet, in the form of a posteriori-derived dietary patterns, andmicrobiota composition has not been adequately studied, particularly in older men. Objective: The objective was to investigate the association of dietary patterns with the composition and diversity of the gut bacterial microbiota in community-dwelling, older men. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 517 men who were participants in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (>= 65 y of age at baseline in 2000-2002) and who provided a stool sample and completed an FFQ at MrOS Visit 4 in 2014-2016. Dietary patterns were derived by factor analysis. 16S ribosomal RNA target gene sequencing was performed and taxonomy assignments were derived using the Greengenes database. Linear regression and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) considered variations in alpha and beta diversity by dietary pattern, and a model that implements a 0-inflated Gaussian distribution of mean group abundance for each taxa (metagenomeSeq) assessed taxonomic variations by dietary pattern. Results: In multivariable-adjusted models, greater adherence to the Western pattern was positively associated with families Mogibacteriaceae and Veillonellaceae and genera Alistipes, Anaerotruncus, CC-115, Collinsella, Coprobacillus, Desulfovibrio, Dorea, Eubacterium, and Ruminococcus, while greater adherence to the prudent pattern was positively associated with order Streptophyta, family Victivallaceae, and genera Cetobacterium, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Paraprevotella, and Veillonella. The relative abundance of the dominant gut bacterial phyla, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, did not differ between participants with greater adherence to the Western pattern, compared with those with greater adherence to the prudent pattern. Dietary patternswere not associated with measures of alpha diversity, but beta diversity measures were significantly associated with both Western and prudent patterns. Conclusions: We observed significant associations between dietary patterns and measures of gut microbial composition in this sample of community-dwelling, older men.","2019-10","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-07-19 18:16:29","","1003-1014","","4","110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the dynamics of the recovery from this disease is of clinical interest. This work aims to correlate the dynamics of gut microbiota with the evolution of children who were suffering from acute infectious diarrhea caused by a rotavirus, and their recovery after the administration of a probiotic, Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745. The experiment involved 10 children with acute infectious diarrhea caused by a rotavirus, and six healthy children, all aged between 3 and 4 years. The children who suffered the rotavirus infection received S. boulardii CNCM I-745 twice daily for the first 5 days of the experiment. Fecal samples were collected from each participant at 0, 3, 5, 10, and 30 days after probiotic administration. Microbial composition was characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity were calculated, along with dynamical analysis based on Taylor's law to assess the temporal stability of the microbiota. All children infected with the rotavirus stopped having diarrhea at day 3 after the intervention. We observed low alpha diversities in the first 5 days (p-value <0.05, Wilcoxon test), larger at 10 and 30 days after probiotic treatment. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed differences in the gut microbiota of healthy children and of those who suffered from acute diarrhea in the first days (p-value <0.05, ADONIS test), but not in the last days of the experiment. Temporal variability was larger in children infected with the rotavirus than in healthy ones. In particular, Gammaproteobacteria class was found to be abundant in children with acute diarrhea. We identified the microbiota transition from a diseased state to a healthy one with time, whose characterization may lead to relevant clinical data. This work highlights the importance of using time series for the study of dysbiosis related to diarrhea.","2018-06-12","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-07-19 18:21:09","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This was a prospective study of marmosets housed at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies in San Antonio, Texas. Eligible animals included healthy young adult males (age 2-5 years) with no recent medication use.

Overall, significant differences in the percent relative abundance was seen in FMT recipients at the phylum and family levels from baseline to 1 month and baseline to 6 months post-FMT. In permutational multivariate analysis of variance analyses, treatment status (donor vs. recipient) (p = .056) and time course (p = .019) predicted beta diversity (p = .056). The FMT recipients did not experience any negative health outcomes over the course of the treatment. FMT via oral gavage was safe to administer to young adult marmosets.

The sealers' effect on the biofilm biomass and metabolic activity was quantified using crystal violet (CV) staining and MTT assay, respectively. Biofilm community composition and morphology were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), 16S rRNA sequencing and scanning electron microscopy. The ISO6876:2012 specifications were followed to determine the setting time, radiopacity, flowability and solubility. Obturated acrylic teeth were used to assess the sealers' effect on pH. Surface chemical characterization was performed using SEM with coupled energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. One-way anova and Tukey's tests were used to analyze data from setting time, radiopacity, flowability and solubility. Two-way anova and Dunnett's tests were used for the data analysis from CV, MTT and pH. 16S rRNA sequencing data were analyzed for alpha (Shannon index and Chao analysis) and beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarities). Differences in community composition were evaluated by analysis of similarity (p < .05). Results The sealers significantly influenced microbial community composition and morphology. All sealers complied with ISO6876:2012 requirements for setting time, radiopacity and flowability. Although only AHP effectively reduced the biofilm biomass, all sealers, except BRR, reduced biofilm metabolic activity. Conclusion Despite adequate physical properties, none of the sealers tested prevented biofilm growth. Significant changes in community composition were observed.

In this preliminary observational study, we investigated the effect of different antibiotic regimens, administered during the first week of life, on microbial composition and diversity in very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. We performed fecal sampling of breastfed VLBW infants on days 7, 14, and 30. After excluding stool samples from infants who received probiotics or who were administered antibiotics beyond the age of 7 days, we compared gut microbiota profiles between infants receiving a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for 3 days (AG group, n = 10) and those receiving a combination of ampicillin and cefotaxime for 7 days (AC group, n = 14) using 16S ribosomal DNA community profiling. We also assessed the changes over time in each group. Compared to the AG group, Enterococcus species were significantly more abundant in the AC group (P = 0.002), especially in 7-day samples (12.3 vs. 0.6%, respectively, P = 0.032). No difference was observed at phylum and genus level over time within each group. Species richness in the AC group decreased significantly in the 14-day (P = 0.038) and 30-day (P = 0.03) samples compared to that in the 7-day sample. The same was observed for microbial evenness; in contrast, no significant difference in Shannon index and beta-diversity was detected between the two groups. Controlling for relevant confounding variables did not change the results. In conclusion, different antibiotic regimens affect the early development of gut microbiota in VLBW preterm infants. Prolonged use of ampicillin and cefotaxime might result in overabundance of Enterococcus. However, given that no significant differences were observed in 1-month samples, bacterial genera appear to continue colonizing the gastrointestinal tract despite previous exposure to antibiotics. The clinical relevance of these findings should be elucidated by further studies.","2021-05-31","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-07-19 17:53:05","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-antibiotics; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We characterized the function of the gut microbiota, their metabolites and receptors in untreated human hypertensive participants in Australian metropolitan and regional areas. Ambulatory blood pressure, fecal microbiome predicted from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, plasma and fecal metabolites called short-chain fatty acid, and expression of their receptors were analyzed in 70 untreated and otherwise healthy participants from metropolitan and regional communities. Most normotensives were female (66%) compared with hypertensives (35%, P<0.01), but there was no difference in age between the groups (59.2 +/- 7.7 versus 60.3 +/- 6.6 years old). Based on machine learning multivariate covariance analyses of de-noised amplicon sequence variant prevalence data, we determined that there were no significant differences in predicted gut microbiome alpha- and beta-diversity metrics between normotensives versus essential or masked hypertensives. However, select taxa were specific to these groups, notably Acidaminococcus spp., Eubacterium fissicatena, and Muribaculaceae were higher, while Ruminococcus and Eubacterium eligens were lower in hypertensives. Importantly, normotensive and essential hypertensive cohorts could be differentiated based on gut microbiome gene pathways and metabolites. Specifically, hypertensive participants exhibited higher plasma acetate and butyrate, but their immune cells expressed reduced levels of short-chain fatty acid-activated GPR43 (G-protein coupled receptor 43).

But despite the rapid growth of the field, many uncertainties remain regarding the impact of differing methodologies on downstream results. Sample storage temperature is conventionally thought to be among the most important factors for ensuring reproducibility across marker gene studies, but to date much of the research on this topic has focused on short-term storage in the context of clinical applications. Consequently, it has remained unclear if storage at -80 degrees C, widely viewed as the gold standard for long-term archival of feces, is truly required for maintaining sample integrity in amplicon-based studies. A better understanding of the impacts of long-term storage conditions is important given the substantial cost and limited availability of ultra-low temperature freezers. To this end, we compared bacterial microbiome profiles inferred from 16S V3-V4 amplicon sequencing for paired fecal samples obtained from a feral horse population from Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, stored at either -80 degrees C or -20 degrees C for 4 years. We found that storage temperature did not significantly affect alpha diversity measures, including amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and evenness, and abundance of rare sequence variants, nor presence/absence, relative abundances and phylogenetic diversity weighted measures of beta diversity. These results indicate that storage of equine feces at -20 degrees C for periods ranging from a few months to a few years is equivalent to storage at -80 degrees C for amplicon-based microbiome studies, adding to accumulating evidence indicating that standard domestic freezers are both economical and effective for microbiome research.","2021-03-09","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-06-29 17:40:48","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; var-sampling methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous evidence sug-gests that the gut microbiota may contribute to differences in oral vaccine efficacy. Methods: We performed whole metagenome shotgun sequencing on stool samples and measured anti-rotavirus immunoglobulin A in plasma samples from a subset of infants enrolled in a cluster randomized 2 x 2 factorial trial of improved water, sanitation and hygiene and infant feeding in rural Zimbabwe (SHINE trial: NCT01824940). We examined taxonomic microbiome composition and functional metagen-ome features using random forest models, differential abundance testing and regression analyses to explored associations with RVV immunogenicity. Results: Among 158 infants with stool samples and anti-rotavirus IgA titres, 34 were RVV seroconverters. The median age at stool collection was 43 days (IQR: 35-68), corresponding to a median of 4 days before the first RVV dose. The infant microbiome was dominated by Bifidobacterium longum. The gut microbiome differed significantly between early (<42 days) and later samples (>42 days) however, we observed no meaningful differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, species composition or functional metagenomic features by RVV seroconversion status. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was the only species associated with anti-rotavirus IgA titre. Random forest models poorly classified seroconversion status by both composi-tion and functional microbiome variables. Conclusions: RVV immunogenicity is low in this rural Zimbabwean setting, however it was not associated with the composition or function of the early-life gut microbiome in this study. Further research is war-ranted to examine the mechanisms of poor oral RVV efficacy in low-income countries. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Genera that were significantly associated with ENL production (e.g., Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Slackia, Senegalimassilia) were unique to each group. Bacteria (e.g., Fusobacteria, Pyramidobacter and Odoribacter) previously associated with colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease, both diet-related chronic diseases, were unique to either AA or EA and were significantly reduced in the FS intervention. This study suggests that ethnic variation in ENL metabolism may be linked to gut microbiota composition, and its impact on disease risk deserves future investigation.","2021-03","2022-06-27 16:29:02","2022-07-19 18:19:08","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-diet; var-ethnicity; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesised that TIP/S has additional `off-target' effects beyond merely P. aeruginosa and that baseline microbiome prior to initiation of therapy is associated with subsequent patient response. Methods We drew sputum samples from a prospectively collected biobank. Patients were included if they had one sputum sample in the 18 months before and after TIP/S. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene profiling was used to characterise the sputum microbiome. Results Forty-one patients met our inclusion criteria and 151 sputum samples were assessed. At baseline, median age was 30.4 years (IQR 24.2-35.2) and forced expiratory volume in 1 (FEV1) second was 57% predicted (IQR 44-74). Nineteen patients were defined a priori as responders having no net decrease in FEV1 in the year following TIP/S. No significant changes were observed in key microbiome metrics of alpha (within-sample) or beta (between-sample) diversity for samples collected before and after TIP/S. However, significant beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis) differences were noted at baseline between patients based on response status. Notably, responders were observed to have a higher abundance of Staphylococcus in pretherapy baseline samples. Conclusions Our longitudinal study demonstrates that the sputum microbiome of patients with CF is relatively stable following inhaled tobramycin over many months. Intriguingly, our findings suggest that baseline microbiome may associate with patient response to TIP/S-suggesting the sputum microbiome could be used to personalise therapy.","2020-12","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-06-30 19:38:21","","1058-1064","","12","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that strawberry supplementation alters gut microbial ecology in diabetic db/db mice. Control (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice (7 weeks old) consumed standard diet or diet supplemented with 235% freeze-dried strawberry (db/db + SB) for 10 weeks. Colon contents were used to isolate bacterial DNA. V4 variable region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified. Data analyses were performed using standardized pipelines (QIIME 1.9 and R packages). Differences in predictive metagenomics function were identified by PICRUSt. Principal coordinate analyses confirmed that the microbial composition was significantly influenced by both host genotype and strawberry consumption. Further, alpha-diversity indices and beta-diversity were different at the phylum and genus levels, and genus and operational taxonomical units levels, respectively (P<.05). At the phylum level, strawberry supplementation decreased the abundance of Verrucomicrobia in db/db + SB vs. db/db mice (P<.05). At the genus level, db/db mice exhibited a decrease in the abundance of Bifidobacterium, and strawberry supplementation increased Bifidobacterium in db/db + SB vs. db/db mice (P<.05). PICRUSt revealed significant differences in 45 predicted metabolic functions among the 3 groups. Our study provides evidence for marked changes in the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiome with strawberry supplementation in diabetic mice. Importantly, strawberry supplementation increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria Bifidobacterium which play a pivotal role in the metabolism of anthocyanins. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

I.","Moderate Exercise Has Limited but Distinguishable Effects on the Mouse Microbiome","MSYSTEMS","","","10.1128/mSystems.00006-17","","The gut microbiome is known to have a complex yet vital relationship with host health. While both exercise and the gut microbiome have been shown to impact human health independently, the direct effects of moderate exercise on the intestinal microbiota remain unclear. In this study, we compared gut microbial diversity and changes in inflammatory markers associated with exercise over an 8-week period in mice that performed either voluntary exercise (VE) (n = 10) or moderate forced exercise (FE) (n = 11) and mice that did not perform any exercise (n = 21). VE mice, but not FE mice, had increased food intake and lean body mass compared to sedentary mice. The levels of inflammatory markers associated with exercise were similar for mice in all three groups. Traditional microbial profiles comparing operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in samples (P > 0.1) and multivariate analysis of beta diversity via Adonis testing (P > 0.1) did not identify significantly altered taxonomic profiles in the voluntary or forced exercise group compared to the sedentary controls. However, a random forests machine learning model, which takes into account the relationships between bacteria in a community, classified voluntary exercisers and nonexercisers with 97% accuracy at 8 weeks. The top bacteria used by the model allowed us to identify known taxa (Bacteroides, S24-7, and Lactobacillus) and novel taxa (Rikenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae) associated with exercise. Although aerobic exercise in mice did not result in significant changes of abundance in gut microbes or in host inflammatory response, more sophisticated computational methods could identify some microbial shifts. More study is needed on the effects of various exercise intensities and their impact on the gut microbiome. IMPORTANCE The bacteria that live in our gut have a complex yet vital relationship with our health. Environmental factors that influence the gut microbiome are of great interest, as recent research demonstrates that these microbes, mostly bacteria, are important for normal host physiology. Diseases such as obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer have also been linked to shifts in the microbiome. Exercise is known to have beneficial effects on these diseases; however, much less is known about its direct impact on the gut microbiome. Our results illustrate that exercise has a moderate but measurable effect on gut microbial communities in mice. These methods can be used to provide important insight into other factors affecting the microbiome and our health.","2017-08","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-07-19 17:14:12","","","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated differences in the gut microbiome composition and the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in faeces from four migratory waterbirds wintering in South-West Spain that differ in their habitat use. The white stork Ciconia ciconia and lesser black-backed gull Carus Justus are omnivorous and opportunistic birds that use highly anthropogenic habitats such as landfills and urban areas. The greylag goose Anser anser and common crane Grus grus are herbivores and use more natural habitats. Fresh faeces from 15 individuals of each species were analysed to assess the composition of bacterial communities using 16S rRNA amplicon-targeted sequencing, and to quantify the abundance of the Class I integron integrase gene (intl1) as well as genes encoding resistance to sulfonamides (sul1), beta-lactams (bla(TEM), bla(KPC). and bla(NDM)), tetracyclines (tetW), fluoroquinolones (qnrS), and colistin (mcr-1) using qPCR. Bacterial communities in gull faeces were the richest and most diverse. Beta diversity analysis showed segregation in faecal communities between bird spedes, but those from storks and gulls were the most similar, these being the species that regularly feed in landfills. Potential bacterial pathogens identified in faeces differed significantly between bird species, with higher relative abundance in gulls. Faeces from birds that feed in landfills (stork and gull) contained a significantly higher abundance of ARGs (sul1, bla(TEM), and tetW). Genes conferring resistance to last resort antibiotics such as carbapenems (bla(KPC)) and colistin (mcr-1) were only observed in faeces from gulls. These results show that these bird species are reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and suggest that waterbirds may disseminate antibiotic resistance across environments (e.g., from landfills to ricefields or water supplies), and thus constitute a risk for their further spread to wildlife and humans.

Horses that develop antimicrobial-associated diarrhea (AAD) show greater derangements in their bacterial community composition compared to antibiotic (ABX) and non-antibiotic (CON) control horses. Horses with AAD have altered metabolic profiles compared to ABX and CON horses. Diarrhea is an adverse effect of antimicrobial therapy in horses. This matched, case-controlled study compared the fecal microbiome and metabolome of horses on antibiotics that developed diarrhea (AAD, n = 17) to those that did not develop diarrhea (ABX, n = 15) and to a control population not exposed to antibiotics (CON, n = 31). Fecal samples were collected from horses that were matched for diet and antimicrobial agent (including dose, route, and duration of therapy). Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed, and QIIME 2.0 was used to generate alpha and beta diversity metrics. Untargeted metabolomics using GC-MS platforms was performed and analyzed using Metaboanalyst 5.0. Microbiome composition was significantly different in AAD compared to CON (ANOSIM, R = 0.568, p = 0.001) but not to ABX (ANOSIM, R = 0.121, p = 0.0012). AAD and ABX horses had significantly decreased richness and evenness compared to CON horses (p < 0.05). Horses on antimicrobials (AAD and ABX) had significant changes in 14 phyla compared to CON horses. Only Verrucomicrobia distinguished AAD from ABX and CON horses (q = 0.0005). Metabolite profiles of horses with AAD clustered separately from ABX and CON horses. Seven metabolites were found to be significantly different between groups (p < 0.05): L-tyrosine, kynurenic acid, xanthurenic acid, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid, docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester, daidzein, and N-acetyltyramine.

Although host diet is a major factor influencing the composition of the gut micro-organismal community, few comparative studies have considered how differences in diet influence community composition across the length of the GI tract. We used 16S sequencing to compare the microbiota along the length of the GI tract in Abert's (Sciurus aberti) and fox squirrels (S. niger) living in the same habitat. While fox squirrels are generalist omnivores, the diet of Abert's squirrels is unusually high in plant fiber, particularly in winter when they extensively consume fiber-rich inner bark of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Consistent with previous studies, microbiota of the upper GI tract of both species consisted primarily of facultative anaerobes and was less diverse than that of the lower GI tract, which included mainly obligate anaerobes. While we found relatively little differentiation between the species in the microbiota of the upper GI tract, the community composition of the lower GI tract was clearly delineated. Notably, the Abert's squirrel lower GI community was more stable in composition and enriched for microbes that play a role in the degradation of plant fiber. In contrast, overall microbial diversity was higher in fox squirrels. We hypothesize that these disparities reflect differences in diet quality and diet breadth between the species.","2019-12","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-07-18 22:15:51","","13344-13358","","23","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-squirrel gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gut microbiota composition was analyzed using the QIIME bioinformatics software and represented through diversity metrics and taxa analyses. Cardiorespiratory fitness, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep dysfunction were assessed at M0 and M3 via the submaximal treadmill test, Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Results Increased fatigue interference in BCS was associated with increased mean within-sample Shannon diversity (organism richness and evenness) (p = 0.009). Weighted UniFrac analysis (shifts in taxa relative abundance) revealed significant differences in between-sample (beta) diversity for changes in fatigue interference (p = 0.01) and anxiety (p = 0.022), with a trend observed for fatigue intensity and sleep dysfunction (p < 0.1).

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention clinical trial to assess the safety (primary endpoint) of and gut microbiota response (secondary endpoint) to the daily ingestion for 4 weeks of two doses (1 or 3 bottles/day) of a fermented milk product (Test) in 96 healthy adults. The Test product is a multi-strain fermented milk product, combining yogurt strains and probiotic candidate strains Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei CNCM I-1518 and CNCM I-3689 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus CNCM I-3690. We assessed the safety of the Test product on the following parameters: adverse events, vital signs, hematological and metabolic profile, hepatic, kidney or thyroid function, inflammatory markers, bowel habits and digestive symptoms. We explored the longitudinal gut microbiota response to product consumption and dose, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and functional contribution by shotgun metagenomics. Safety results did not show any significant difference between the Test and Control products whatever the parameters assessed, at the two doses ingested daily over a 4-week-period. Probiotic candidate strains were detected only during consumption period, and at a significantly higher level for the three strains in subjects who consumed 3 products bottles/day. The global structure of the gut microbiota as assessed by alpha and beta-diversity, was not altered by consumption of the product for four weeks. A zero-inflated beta regression model with random effects (ZIBR) identified a few bacterial genera with differential responses to test product consumption dose compared to control.

Despite their frequency, depression and CMI are bidirectional related conditions, each is a risk for the other, and they often co-exist, suggesting shared or interacting pathomechanisms. Accumulating data revealed the effects of gut microbiota in terms of regulating depression via the gut-brain axis. Thus, we investigated the role of gut microbial dysbiosis in CMI-induced depression-like behavior. Hierarchical cluster analysis of sucrose preference test (SPT) results was adopted to classify the CMI rats into depression-like behavior (CMI + Dep) or non-depression-like behavior (CMI + Non-Dep) phenotypes. First, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analysis showed both beta-diversity and relative abundance of several gut bacteria significantly differed between the CMI + Dep and CMI + Non-Dep rats. Next, transplantation of fecal microbiota from CMI + Dep rats visibly altered the relative abundance of gut microbiota and also induced depression-like behavior in the antibiotics-treated pseudo-germ-free rats. In conclusion, these findings suggested that dysbiosis in gut microbial composition contributed to the onset of CMI-induced depression-like behavior and that exogenous regulation of gut microbiota composition could be a potential therapeutic strategy for CMI and related depression-like behavior.","2022-04-14","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-07-19 14:55:28","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-disease; var-disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, widely used non-invasive cloacal swab methods and under-explored museum specimens preserved in alcohol provide promising avenues to increase our understanding of wild bird microbiomes, provided that they accurately portray natural microbial community compositions. To investigate this assertion, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of Great tit (Parus major) gut microbiomes to compare 1) microbial communities obtained from dissected digestive tract regions and cloacal swabs, and 2) microbial communities obtained from freshly dissected gut regions and from samples preserved in alcohol for 2 weeks or 2 months, respectively. Results We found no significant differences in alpha diversities in communities of different gut regions and cloacal swabs (except in OTU richness between the dissected cloacal region and the cloacal swabs), or between fresh and alcohol preserved samples. However, we did find significant differences in beta diversity and community composition of cloacal swab samples compared to different gut regions. Despite these community-level differences, swab samples qualitatively captured the majority of the bacterial diversity throughout the gut better than any single compartment. Bacterial community compositions of alcohol-preserved specimens did not differ significantly from freshly dissected samples, although some low-abundant taxa were lost in the alcohol preserved specimens. Conclusions Our findings suggest that cloacal swabs, similar to non-invasive fecal sampling, qualitatively depict the gut microbiota composition without having to collect birds to extract the full digestive tract. The satisfactory depiction of gut microbial communities in alcohol preserved samples opens up for the possibility of using an enormous resource readily available through museum collections to characterize bird gut microbiomes. The use of extensive museum specimen collections of birds for microbial gut analyses would allow for investigations of temporal patterns of wild bird gut microbiomes, including the potential effects of climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Overall, the utilization of cloacal swabs and museum alcohol specimens can positively impact bird gut microbiome research to help increase our understanding of the role and evolution of wild bird hosts and gut microbial communities.","2020-03-17","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-07-19 18:06:39","","","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-bird gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to investigate whether the differential composition of the lung microbiome could affect the sustained clinical responses in lung cancers treated with immunotherapy. Methods: Twenty-seven non-responders and 19 responders treated with anti-PD-1 therapy were included in the discovery set. Bacterial load in bronchoalveolar lavage from lung cancer patients was examined by quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA copies. Bacterial 16S rDNA was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq on the 16S rDNA V3-V4 variable region. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis was performed using VSEARCH v2. The alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were calculated using QIIME software. Results: The mean copy number of bacterial 16S DNA levels significantly decreased after anti-PD-1 treatment (after: 1.8 +/- 0.6x10(4) copies per milliliter vs prior to treatment: 3.3 +/- 1.1x10(4), p = 0.0036). In addition, longitudinal analysis revealed that microbial diversity was reduced taxonomically after treatment compared to those prior to the treatment (Shannon values: before: 3.291 +/- 0.067 vs after: 2.668 +/- 0.168, p < 0.01). Further, we observed a reduction of Fusobacterium nucleatum, including phylum Fusobacteria (p < 0.01), class Fusobacteria (p < 0.01), order Fusobacteria (p < 0.01), family Fusobacteria (p < 0.01), genus Fusobacteria (p = 0.025) in the responders post anti-PD-1 treatment. However, there was no significant difference of Fusobacterium in non-responders. An independent cohort was used to validate the levels of Fusobacterium, demonstrating that patients with higher abundance of Fusobacterium prior to treatment were significantly more likely to have poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Airway enriched Fusobacterium prior to anti-PD-1 therapy is associated with poor response in lung cancer, which indicated that potential resistance to immunotherapy can be attributed to lung microbiome.","2022","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-06-30 18:47:22","","201-213","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human lung; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the biogeographic assemblies of these communities, especially in large rivers suffering from cascade dam regulation. Here, we used a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach to investigate the biogeographic patterns and underlying assembly mechanisms of abundant and rare bacterioplankton taxa in cascade reservoirs of the Jinsha River in China. The results revealed species loss of bacterioplankton due to dam construction, which was more significant for rare taxa than for abundant ones. The distributions of abundant and rare taxa exhibited similar spatial and temporal patterns, which were significantly distinct between winter and summer and between upstream and downstream reservoirs. Both spatial (dispersal-related process) and environmental (selection process) factors seemed to together govern the assembly and biogeography of abundant and rare taxa, although both factors explained only a small fraction of variation in the rare taxa. More importantly, environmental factors explained more community variation in abundant sub-community than that in rare sub-community. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that abundant species with closer interactions were more often located in a central position of the network compared with rare species. Nevertheless, half of the keystone species were rare species and may play important roles in maintaining the network stability. Overall, these findings indicate that distinct assembly mechanisms underlie the similar biogeography of rare and abundant bacteria in cascade reservoirs of a large river.","2020-02-07","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-06-30 17:00:51","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our analyses indicated that protist communities were governed more strongly by species sorting relative to dispersal limitation than were bacterial communities; this pattern was consistent across the three-depth layers, albeit to different degrees. Furthermore, we detected that bacteria exhibited wider habitat niche breadths than protists, whereas, passive dispersal abilities were not appreciably different between them.

Yet, the relationship between the gut microbiome and clinical improvement in RA disease activity remains unclear. In this study, we explored the gut microbiome of patients with RA to identify features that are associated with, as well as predictive of, minimum clinically important improvement (MCII) in disease activity. Methods We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study on patients diagnosed with RA between 1988 and 2014. Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed on 64 stool samples, which were collected from 32 patients with RA at two separate time-points approximately 6-12 months apart. The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of each patient was measured at both time-points to assess achievement of MCII; depending on this clinical status, patients were distinguished into two groups: MCII+ (who achieved MCII; n = 12) and MCII- (who did not achieve MCII; n = 20). Multiple linear regression models were used to identify microbial taxa and biochemical pathways associated with MCII while controlling for potentially confounding factors. Lastly, a deep-learning neural network was trained upon gut microbiome, clinical, and demographic data at baseline to classify patients according to MCII status, thereby enabling the prediction of whether a patient will achieve MCII at follow-up. Results We found age to be the largest determinant of the overall compositional variance in the gut microbiome (R-2 = 7.7%, P = 0.001, PERMANOVA). Interestingly, the next factor identified to explain the most variance in the gut microbiome was MCII status (R-2 = 3.8%, P = 0.005). Additionally, by looking at patients' baseline gut microbiome profiles, we observed significantly different microbiome traits between patients who eventually showed MCII and those who did not. Taxonomic features include alpha- and beta-diversity measures, as well as several microbial taxa, such as Coprococcus, Bilophila sp. 4_1_30, and Eubacterium sp. 3_1_31. Notably, patients who achieved clinical improvement had higher alpha-diversity in their gut microbiomes at both baseline and follow-up visits. Functional profiling identified fifteen biochemical pathways, most of which were involved in the biosynthesis of L-arginine, L-methionine, and tetrahydrofolate, to be differentially abundant between the MCII patient groups. Moreover, MCII+ and MCII- groups showed significantly different fold-changes (from baseline to follow-up) in eight microbial taxa and in seven biochemical pathways. These results could suggest that, depending on the clinical course, gut microbiomes not only start at different ecological states, but also are on separate trajectories. Finally, the neural network proved to be highly effective in predicting which patients will achieve MCII (balanced accuracy = 90.0%, leave-one-out cross-validation), demonstrating potential clinical utility of gut microbiome profiles. Conclusions Our findings confirm the presence of taxonomic and functional signatures of the gut microbiome associated with MCII in RA patients. Ultimately, modifying the gut microbiome to enhance clinical outcome may hold promise as a future treatment for RA.","2021-09-14","2022-06-27 16:29:03","2022-06-30 20:49:16","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods and results The microbiota composition of two cross-sectional cohorts (discovery, n = 40 and validation, n = 44) of patients with systolic HF and healthy controls (n = 266) was characterized by sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The overall microbial community (beta diversity) differed between patients with HF and healthy controls in both cohorts (P < 0.05).

The present study aimed to examine the lipid-lowering effect of rosuvastatin and the composition, diversity and species abundance of gut microbiome in association with rosuvastatin efficacy. Trial registration: ChiCTR-ORC-17013212 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, November 2, 2017. Results: Totally 64 patients with hyperlipidemia were treated with 10 mg/day of rosuvastatin for 4-8 weeks. Blood lipid indicators triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured before and after the treatment. Stool samples were collected right after the treatment. Following total DNA extraction and PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene, Illumina sequencing was performed for gut microbiome identification, classification and characterization. All the patients showed a significant blood lipid reduction after the treatment. The patients were grouped according to parallel manner design. Group I had 33 patients whose blood lipid levels dropped to the normal levels from week 4, with 58.5% reduction in LDL-C and 26.6% reduction in TC. Group II had 31 patients whose blood lipid levels were still above the normal levels after 8 weeks therapy, but with 41.9% reduction in LDL-C and 31.2% reduction in TC. Based on Operational Taxonomic Unit data, Alpha-diversity by Shannon Index was different between the two groups, and beta-diversity by Principle Component Analysis exhibited separated patterns of the two groups. The differences were also observed in the relative-abundance at phylum, family, and genus levels of the two groups. Linear discriminate analysis illustrated that the abundance of 29 taxa was higher in group I, while the abundance of other 13 taxa was higher in group II. Phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria had negative correlation to LDL-C level, but Cyanobacteria and Lentisphaerae had a positive correlation to LDL-C level. Moreover, gender and age were also found somehow correlated to microbial community composition. Conclusion: Rosuvastatin therapy had different blood lipid-lowering effect on hyperlipidemia. The gut microbiota exhibited variation in community composition, diversity and taxa in association to rosuvastatin hypolipidemic effect. These results indicate that modulation of gut microflora, especially the negative/positive correlated species might strengthen statin efficacy in statin-inadequate patients.","2018-03-22","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 14:45:46","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If microbial communities could be reconstructed from archived soil DNA, as prehistoric plant communities are reconstructed via pollen data, soil archive resources would assume even greater value for reconstructing land-use history, forensic science, and biosphere modelling. Yet, the effects of long-term soil archival on the preservation of microbial DNA is still largely unknown. To address this, we assessed the capacity of high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of ITS (internal transcribed spacer) and prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes for reconstructing soil microbial communities across a 20 years time-series. We studied air-dried soil archives and fresh soil samples taken fromPopulusbioenergy and deciduous forest research plots at the Kellogg Biological Station. Habitat and archival time explained significant amounts of variation in soil microbial alpha- and beta-diversity both in fungal and prokaryotic communities. We found that microbial richness, diversity, and abundance generally decreased with storage time, but varied between habitat and taxonomic groups. The high relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal species includingHebelomaandCortinariusdetected in older soil archives raises questions regarding traits such as long-term persistence and viability of ectomycorrhizal propagules in soils, with relevance to forest health and ecosystem succession.Talaromyces,PaecilomycesandEpicoccumspp. were detected in fresh and across 20-year-old archived soils and were also cultured from these soils demonstrating their long-term spore viability. In summary, we found that microbial DNA in air-dried soils archived over the past 20 years degraded with time, in a manner that differed between soil types and phylogenetic groups of microbes.","2020-08-11","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-06-30 17:03:04","","","","8","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Genetic variation among oysters is known to influence the response of oysters to climate change and may ameliorate any adverse effects on oyster microbiome; however, this remains unstudied. Nine full-sibling selected breeding lines of the Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) were exposed to predicted warming (ambient = 24 degrees C, elevated = 28 degrees C) and ocean acidification (ambient pCO(2) = 400, elevated pCO(2) = 1000 mu atm) for 4 weeks. The haemolymph bacterial microbiome was characterized using 16S rRNA (V3-V4) gene sequencing and varied among oyster lines in the control (ambient pCO(2), 24 degrees C) treatment. Microbiomes were also altered by climate change dependent on oyster lines. Bacterial alpha-diversity increased in response to elevated pCO(2) in two selected lines, while bacterial beta-diversity was significantly altered by combinations of elevated pCO(2) and temperature in four selected lines. Climate change treatments caused shifts in the abundance of multiple amplicon sequence variants driving change in the microbiome of some selected lines. We show that oyster genetic background may influence the Sydney rock oyster haemolymph microbiome under climate change and that future assisted evolution breeding programs to enhance resilience should consider the oyster microbiome.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-06-30 18:54:18","","","","8","97","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-invertebrate blood; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The diversity estimators in the OP and ON groups were increased compared with those in the NC group. Beta diversity analyses based on hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) could discriminate the NC samples from OP and ON samples.

The Human Oral Microbe Identification Using Next-Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS) approach was used to analyze the microbiomes of site-specific supragingival dental plaques from children with different caries status. Fifty-five children (2 to 7 years of age) were assessed at baseline and at 12 months and grouped as caries free (CF), caries active with enamel lesions (CAE), and caries active with dentin carious lesions (CA). Plaque samples from cariesfree tooth surfaces (PF) and from enamel carious lesions (PE) and dentin carious lesions (PD) were collected. 16S community profiles were obtained by HOMINGS, and 408 bacterial species and 84 genus probes were assigned. Plaque bacterial communities showed temporal stability, as there was no significant difference in beta diversity values between the baseline and 12-month samples. Irrespective of collection time points, the microbiomes of healthy tooth surfaces differed substantially from those found during caries activity. All pairwise comparisons of beta diversity values between groups were significantly different (P < 0.05), except for comparisons between the CA-PF, CAE-PE, and CA-PE groups. Streptococcus genus probe 4 and Neisseria genus probe 2 were the most frequently detected taxa across the plaque groups, followed by Streptococcus sanguinis, which was highly abundant in CF-PF. Well-known acidogenic/aciduric species such as Streptococcus mutans, Scardovia wiggsiae, Parascardovia denticolens, and Lactobacillus salivarius were found almost exclusively in CA-PD. The microbiomes of supragingival dental plaque differ substantially among tooth surfaces and children of different caries activities.

The specialty of these soils is that parent rock material is more influential in shaping soil characteristics than zonal factors such as climate, especially during soil formation. Unlike fast evolving Podzols due to their leaching regime, Leptosols do not undergo rapid development due to the nature of the limestone. Little is known how microbiome reflects this process, so we assessed microbiome composition of Rendzic Leptosols of different ages, arising from disruption and subsequent reclamation. The mountains and foothills that cover much of the Crimean Peninsula are ideal for this type of study, as the soils were formed on limestone and have been subjected to anthropogenic impacts through much of human history. Microbiomes of four soil sites forming a chronosequence, including different soil horizons, were studied using sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries and quantitative PCR. Dominant phyla for all soil sites were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Thaumarchaeota, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes. Alpha diversity was similar across sites and tended to be higher in topsoil. Beta diversity showed that microbiomes diverged according to the soil site and the soil horizon. The oldest and the youngest soils had the most similar microbiomes, which could have been caused by their geographic proximity. Oligotrophic bacteria from Chitinophagaceae, Blastocatellaceae and Rubrobacteriaceae dominated the microbiome of these soils. The microbiome of 700-year old soil was the most diverse. This soil was from the only study location with topsoil formed by plant litter, which provided additional nutrients and could have been the driving force of this differentiation. Consistent with this assumption, this soil was abundant in copiotrophic bacteria from Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla. The microbiome of 50-year old Leptosol was more similar to the microbiome of benchmark soil than the microbiome of 700-year old soil, especially by weighted metrics. CCA analysis, in combination with PERMANOVA, linked differences in microbiomes to the joint change of all soil chemical parameters between soil horizons. Local factors, such as parent material and plant litter, more strongly influenced the microbiome composition in Rendzic Leptosols than soil age.","2021-02-18","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-06-29 17:01:12","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although membership and abundances in gut bacterial communities are strongly influenced by diet, substantially less is known about how viral communities respond to dietary changes. Examining fecal contents of mice as the mice were transitioned from normal chow to HFD, we found significant changes in the relative abundances and the diversity in the gut of bacteria and their viruses. Alpha diversity of the bacterial community was significantly diminished in response to the diet change but did not change significantly in the viral community. However, the diet shift significantly impacted the beta diversity in both the bacterial and viral communities. There was a significant shift away from the relatively abundant Siphoviridae accompanied by increases in bacteriophages from the Microviridae family. The proportion of identified bacteriophage structural genes significantly decreased after the transition to HFD, with a conserved loss of integrase genes in all four experimental groups. In total, this study provides evidence for substantial changes in the intestinal virome disproportionate to bacterial changes, and with alterations in putative viral lifestyles related to chromosomal integration as a result of shift to HFD. IMPORTANCE Prior studies have shown that high-fat diet (HFD) can have profound effects on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiome and also demonstrate that bacteria in the GI tract can affect metabolism and lean/obese phenotypes. We investigated whether the composition of viral communities that also inhabit the GI tract are affected by shifts from normal to HFD. We found significant and reproducible shifts in the content of GI tract viromes after the transition to HFD. The differences observed in virome community membership and their associated gene content suggest that these altered viral communities are populated by viruses that are more virulent toward their host bacteria. Because HFD also are associated with significant shifts in GI tract bacterial communities, we believe that the shifts in the viral community may serve to drive the changes that occur in associated bacterial communities.","2020-02","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-18 22:25:37","","","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-antibiotics; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emerging evidence suggests that Pb exposure may alter the composition of the gut microbiota, however few studies have examined this association in human populations. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between urinary Pb concentration and the composition of the adult gut microbiota in a population-based sample of adults. Methods: Data used in this study were collected as part of the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) and its ancillary microbiome study. The SHOW is a household-based health examination survey of Wisconsin residents, collecting a variety of survey data on health determinants and outcomes, as well as objective measurements of body habitus, and biological specimens including urine. The ancillary microbiome study added additional questions and biological specimen collection, including stool, from participants age 18+. Pb concentration was analyzed in urine samples, and gut microbiota composition was assessed using DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region, extracted from stool samples. Data processing and statistical analyses were performed in mothur, Python, R, and SAS. Results: Of 696 participants, urinary Pb concentration was highest in those age 70+, females, those with a high school diploma or lower, current and former smokers, and those without indoor pets. In adjusted models, increasing urinary Pb levels were associated with increases in microbial a-diversity (p=0.071) and richness (p=0.005). Differences in microbial beta-diversity were significantly associated (p=0.003) with differences in urinary Pb level. Presence of Proteobacteria, including members of the Burkholderiales, was significantly associated with increased urinary Pb. Conclusion: These results suggest that Pb exposure is associated with differences in the composition of the adult gut microbiota in a population-based human sample. Further investigation of this association is warranted.","2019-12","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 15:25:43","","","","A","133","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to infertility, women with PCOS suffer from metabolic dysregulation which increases their risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Studies have shown differences in the gut microbiome of women with PCOS compared to controls, a pattern replicated in PCOS-like mouse models. Recently, using a letrozole (LET)-induced mouse model of PCOS, we demonstrated that cohousing was protective against development of metabolic and reproductive phenotypes and showed via 16S amplicon sequencing that this protection correlated with time-dependent shifts in gut bacteria. Here, we applied untargeted metabolomics and shotgun metagenomics approaches to further analyze the longitudinal samples from the cohousing experiment. Analysis of beta diversity found that untargeted metabolites had the strongest correlation to both disease and cohoused states and that shifts in metabolite diversity were detected prior to shifts in bacterial diversity. In addition, log2 fold analyses found numerous metabolite features, particularly bile acids (BAs), to be highly differentiated between placebo and LET, as well as LET cohoused with placebo versus LET. Our results indicate that changes in gut metabolites, particularly BAs, are associated with a PCOSlike phenotype as well as with the protective effect of cohousing. Our results also suggest that transfer of metabolites via coprophagy occurs rapidly and may precipitate changes in bacterial diversity. This study joins a growing body of research linking changes in primary and secondary BAs to host metabolism and gut microbes relevant to the pathology of PCOS. IMPORTANCE Using a combination of untargeted metabolomics and metagenomics, we performed a comparative longitudinal analysis of the feces collected in a cohousing study with a PCOS-like mouse model. Our results showed that gut metabolite composition experienced earlier and more pronounced differentiation in both the disease model and cohoused mice compared with the microbial composition. Notably, statistical and machine learning approaches identified shifts in the relative abundance of primary and secondary BAs, which have been implicated as modifiers of gut microbial growth and diversity. Network correlation analysis showed strong associations between particular BAs and bacterial species, particularly members of Lactobacillus, and that these correlations were time and treatment dependent. Our results provide novel insights into host-microbe relationships related to hyperandrogenism in females and indicate that focused research into small-molecule control of gut microbial diversity and host physiology may provide new therapeutic options for the treatment of PCOS.","2021-10","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 14:44:44","","","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; shotgun sequencing; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Eight-week-old male hamsters were fed diets consisting of high-fat/high-fructose, low-fat/high-fructose or a standard chow diet for 14 days. Stool was collected at baseline (day 0), day 7 and day 14. Fasting levels of plasma triglycerides and cholesterol were monitored on day 0, day 7 and day 14, and nonfasting levels were also assayed on day 15. Then, 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples was used to determine gut microbial composition, and predictive metagenomics was performed to evaluate dietary-induced shifts in deduced microbial functions. Results: Both high-fructose diets resulted in divergent gut microbiota composition. A high-fat/high-fructose diet induced the largest shift in overall gut microbial composition, with dramatic shifts in the Firmicute/Bacteroidetes ratio, and changes in beta diversity after just seven days of dietary intervention. Significant associations between genus level taxa and dietary intervention were identified, including an association with Ruminococceace NK4A214 group in high-fat/high-fructose fed animals and an association with Butryimonas with the low-fat/high-fructose diet. High-fat/high-fructose feeding induced dyslipidemia with increases in plasma triglycerides and cholesterol, and hepatomegaly. Dietary-induced changes in several genus level taxa significantly correlated with lipid levels over the two-week period. Differences in microbial metabolic pathways between high-fat/high-fructose and low-fat/high-fructose diet fed hamsters were identified, and several of these pathways also correlated with lipid profiles in hamsters. Conclusions: The high-fat/high-fructose diet caused shifts in the host gut microbiota. These dietary-induced alterations in gut microbial composition were linked to changes in the production of secondary metabolites, which contributed to the development of metabolic syndrome in the host.","2020-11","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 17:33:09","","","","11","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stool samples are generally considered the reference standard but are not practical to obtain in the intensive care unit (ICU), and thus, rectal swabs are often used. However, the reliability of rectal swabs for gut microbiome profiling has not been established in the ICU setting. In this study, we compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing results between rectal swab and stool samples collected at three time points from mechanically ventilated critically ill adults. Rectal swabs comprised 89% of the samples collected at the baseline time point, but stool samples became more extensively available at later time points. Significant differences in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity between rectal swabs and stool samples were observed, but these differences were primarily due to baseline samples. Higher relative abundances of members of the Actinobacteria phylum (typically skin microbes) were present in rectal swabs than in stool samples (P = 0.05), a difference that was attenuated over time. The progressively increasing similarity of rectal swabs and stool samples likely resulted from increasing levels of stool coating of the rectal vault and direct soiling of the rectal swabs taken at later time points. Therefore, inferences about the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness should be drawn cautiously and should take into account the type and timing of samples analyzed. IMPORTANCE Rectal swabs have been proposed as potential alternatives to stool samples for gut microbiome profiling in outpatients or healthy adults, but their reliability in assessment of critically ill patients has not been defined. Because stool sampling is not practical and often not feasible in the intensive care unit, we performed a detailed comparison of gut microbial sequencing profiles between rectal swabs and stool samples in a longitudinal cohort of critically ill patients. We identified systematic differences in gut microbial profiles between rectal swabs and stool samples and demonstrated that the timing of the rectal swab sampling had a significant impact on sequencing results. Our methodological findings should provide valuable information for the design and interpretation of future investigations of the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness.","2019-08","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 14:39:39","","","","4","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-sampling methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a metabarcoding approach, 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from both DNA and RNA transcripts (cDNA) and compared. The relationships between the microbial diversity and the physicochemical factors were explored. Additionally, the cDNA data were used for in silico functionality predictions, bringing new insights into the functional potential and dynamics of these communities. The results showed that each hot spring determined the formation of distinct microbial communities. In the CH mats (40 to 53 degrees C), the abundance of Cyanobacteria decreased with temperature, opposite to those of Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. Ectothiorhodospira, Oscillatoria, and methanogenic archaea dominated the CI communities (20 to 65 degrees C), while the MB microbial mats (53 to 65 degrees C) were mainly composed of Chloroflexi, Hydrogenophilus, Thermi, and Aquificae. Alpha-diversity was negatively correlated with the increase in water temperature, while beta-diversity was shaped in each hot spring by the unique combination of physicochemical parameters, regardless of the type of nucleic acid analyzed (DNA versus cDNA). The rank correlation analysis revealed a unique model that associated environmental data with community composition, consisting in the combined effect of Na+, K+, HCO3-, and PO43- concentrations, together with temperature and electrical conductivity. These factors seem to determine the grouping of samples according to location, rather than with the similarities in thermal regimes, showing that other parameters beside temperature are significant drivers of biodiversity. IMPORTANCE Hot spring microbial mats represent a remarkable manifestation of life on Earth and have been intensively studied for decades. Moreover, as hot spring areas are isolated and have a limited exchange of organisms, nutrients, and energy with the surrounding environments, hot spring microbial communities can be used in model studies to elucidate the colonizing potential within extreme settings. Thus, they are of great importance in evolutionary biology, microbial ecology, and exobiology. In spite of all the efforts that have been made, the current understanding of the influence of temperature and water chemistry on the microbial community composition, diversity, and abundance in microbial mats is limited. In this study, the composition and diversity of microbial communities developed in thermal gradients in the vicinity of three hot springs from Romania were investigated, each having particular physicochemical characteristics. Our results expose new factors that could determine the formation of these ecosystems, expanding the current knowledge in this regard.","2017-11","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 15:30:35","","","","21","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent experimental studies have shown that vegetable oil supplementation ameliorates high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress in mice via modulating hepatic lipid metabolism and the composition of the gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the Torreya grandis kernel oil (TKO) rich in unpolysaturated fatty acid against hyperlipidemia and gain a deep insight into its potential mechanisms. Methods. Normal mice were randomly divided into three groups: ND (normal diet), LO (normal diet supplement with 4% TKO), and HO (normal diet supplement with 8% TKO). Hyperlipidemia mice were randomly divided into two groups: HFN (normal diet) and HFO (normal diet supplement with 8% TKO). Blood biochemistry and histomorphology were observed; liver RNA-seq, metabolomics, and gut 16S rRNA were analyzed. Results. Continuous supplementation of TKO in normal mice significantly ameliorated serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and free fatty acid (FFA) accumulation, decreased blood glucose and malondialdehyde (MDA), and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels. According to GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathways, and significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) might be involved in the metabolism of lipids. High-dose TKO improved gut alpha diversity and beta diversity showing that the microbial community compositions of the five groups were different. Conclusion. Supplementation of TKO functions in the prevention of hyperlipidemia via regulating hepatic lipid metabolism and enhancing microbiota richness in normal mice. Our study is the first to reveal the mechanism of TKO regulating blood lipid levels by using multiomics and promote further studies on TKO for their biological activity.","2022-04-14","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-06-30 17:01:21","","","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Samples were analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing to identify bacterial profiles across age groups: young (<3 years of age), adolescent (3 to 7 years), adult (12 to 15 years), and aged (17 to 23 years). alpha-Diversity of the microbiomes was greater in the adult/aged samples than in the young/adolescent samples. beta-Diversity of the samples demonstrated clear age group differences, albeit individual variation in microbiomes between animals within the age categories was noted. Phylum distributions differed between the young/adolescent animals and the adult/aged animals at each of the time points, showing an enrichment of the phyla Spirochetes, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes associated with periodontitis. Major differences in the top 50 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were noted in the young and adolescent microbiomes during initiation and progression postligation compared to the adult and aged animals. The proportions of a large number of species in the top 50 OTUs were lower at baseline and in resolved disease microbiomes in the young samples, while profiles in adolescent animals were more consistent with the disease microbiomes. Microbiome profiles for resolution for adults and aged animals appeared more resilient and generally maintained a pattern similar to that of disease. Use of the model can expand our understanding of the crucial interactions of the oral microbiome and host responses in periodontitis.","2019-06","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-07-19 17:57:29","","","","6","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-primate oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among these, Hermetia illucens, with good amount of chitin and proteins, represents a suitable diet replacement for laying hens. Little is known about insect diet effects on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract and bacterial metabolites production. In this study we investigated the effect of H. illucens larvae meal administration on cecal microbiota and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in laying hens. 16S rDNA sequencing showed strong differences between cecal microbiota of soybean (SD) and insect diet (ID) groups both in type and relative abundance (unweighted and weighted beta diversity) of microbial species. In particular, Bacteroides plebeius, Elusimicrobium minutum, Alkaliphilus transvaalensis, Christensenella minuta, Vallitalea guaymasensis and Flavonifractor plautii represented the principal contributors of changes in gut microbiota composition of ID group (FDR p-values < 0.05). Of these, F. plautii, C. minuta and A. transvaalensis have the potential to degrade the chitin's insect meal and correlated with the observed high levels of gut SCFAs produced in ID group. These microorganisms may thus connect the chitin degradation with high SCFAs production. Our results suggest H. illucens as a potential prebiotic by well feeding gut microbiota.","2017-11-24","2022-06-27 16:29:04","2022-06-30 17:02:16","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies on carbon and nutrient cycling in tropical lakes suggest a very different seasonality from that of temperate climates. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) to investigate seasonal changes in bacterioplankton communities of two tropical lakes, which differed in trophic status and mixing regime. Our findings revealed seasonally and depth-wise highly dynamic bacterioplankton communities. Differences in richness and structure appeared strongly related to the physicochemical characteristics of the water column, especially phosphate, pH and oxygen. Bacterioplankton communities were dominated by common taxonomic groups, such as Synechococcus and Actinobacteria acI, as well as rare and poorly characterized taxa such as `Candidatus Methylacidiphilum' (Verrucomicrobia). Stratification and oxygen depletion during the rainy season promoted the occurrence of anoxygenic phototrophic and methanotrophic bacteria important for carbon and nutrient cycling. Differences in lake mixing regime were associated with seasonal beta diversity. Our study is the first attempt to use NGS for cataloging the diversity of bacterioplankton communities in Brazilian lakes and thus contributes to the ongoing worldwide endeavor to characterize freshwater lake bacterioplankton signatures.","2017-01","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-27 16:29:05","","","","1","93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clostridioides difficile is an opportunistic pathogen that proliferates and can produce enterotoxins when the host experiences gut dysbiosis. However, even asymptomatic colonization with C. difficile can be associated with differing degrees of microbiota disruption in a range of species, including people, swine, and dogs. Little is known about the interaction between C. difficile and the gut microbiota in dairy calves. In this study, we sought to define microbial features associated with C. difficile colonization in pre-weaned dairy calves less than 2 weeks of age. We characterized the fecal microbiota of 80 calves from 23 different farms using 16S rRNA sequencing and compared the microbiota of C. difficile-positive (n = 24) and C. difficile-negative calves (n = 56). Farm appeared to be the greatest source of variability in the gut microbiota. When controlling for calf age, diet, and farm location, there was no significant difference in Shannon alpha diversity (P = 0.50) or in weighted UniFrac beta diversity (P = 0.19) between C. difficile-positive and-negative calves. However, there was a significant difference in beta diversity as assessed using Bray-Curtiss diversity (P = 0.0077), and C. difficile-positive calves had significantly increased levels of Ruminococcus (gnavus group) (Adj. P = 0.052), Lachnoclostridium (Adj. P = 0.060), Butyricicoccus (Adj. P = 0.060), and Clostridium sensu stricto 2 compared to C. difficile-negative calves. Additionally, C. difficile-positive calves had fewer microbial co-occurrences than C. difficile-negative calves, indicating reduced bacterial synergies. Thus, while C. difficile colonization alone is not associated with dysbiosis and is therefore unlikely to result in an increased likelihood of diarrhea in dairy calves, it may be associated with a more disrupted microbiota.","2021-12-15","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-30 17:01:58","","","","12","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alpine grasslands are the dominant ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau, albeit little is known about the microbial community and diversity among different alpine grassland types. Here, soil bacterial composition and diversity in the upper soils of five alpine grassland ecosystems, alpine meadow (AM), alpine steppe (AS), alpine meadow steppe (AMS), alpine desert (AD), and alpine desert steppe (ADS), were investigated based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Actinobacteria (46.12%) and Proteobacteria (29.67%) were the two dominant soil bacteria at the phylum level in alpine grasslands. There were significant differences in the relative abundance at the genus level among the five different grassland types, especially for the Rubrobacter, Solirubrobacter, Pseudonocardia, Gaiella, Haliangium, and Geodermatophilus. Six alpha diversity indices were calculated based on the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including Good's coverage index, phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree index, Chao1 index, observed species index, Shannon index, and Simpson index. The Good's coverage index value was around 0.97 for all the grassland types in the study area, meaning the soil bacteria samplings sequenced sufficiently. No statistically significant difference was shown in other diversity indices' value, indicating the similar richness and evenness of soil bacteria in these alpine grasslands. The beta diversity, represented by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), showed that OTUs were clustered within alpine grasslands, indicating a clear separation of soil bacterial communities. In addition, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, and soil water content (SWC) were closely related to the variations in soil bacterial compositions. These results indicated that soil bacterial taxonomic compositions were similar, while soil bacterial community structures were different among the five alpine grassland types. The environmental conditions, including SOM, TN, TP, pH, and SWC, might influence the soil bacterial communities on the Tibetan Plateau.","2021-02-16","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-27 16:29:05","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the complex data analyses have required many interfering manual steps often leading to inconsistencies in results. Results: Here, we have developed a pipeline, amplicon sequence analysis pipeline 2 (ASAP 2), to automate and glide through the processes without the usual manual inspections and user's interference, for instance, in the detection of barcode orientation, selection of high-quality region of reads, and determination of resampling depth and many more. The pipeline integrates all the analytical processes such as importing data, demultiplexing, summarizing read profiles, trimming quality, denoising, removing chimeric sequences and making the feature table among others. The pipeline accepts multiple file formats as input including multiplexed or demultiplexed, paired-end or single-end, barcode inside or outside and raw or intermediate data (e.g. feature table). The outputs include taxonomic classification, alpha/beta diversity, community composition, ordination analysis and statistical tests. ASAP 2 supports merging multiple sequencing runs which helps integrate and compare data from different sources (public databases and collaborators). Conclusions: Our pipeline minimizes hands-on interference and runs amplicon sequence variant (ASV)-based amplicon sequencing analysis automatically and consistently.

We used a multiyear time series of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from eight bog lakes to census the freshwater bacterial community and observe annual and seasonal trends in abundance. The sites that we studied encompassed a range of water column mixing frequencies, which we hypothesized would be associated with trends in alpha and beta diversity. Each lake and layer contained a distinct bacterial community, with distinct levels of richness and indicator taxa that likely reflected the environmental conditions of each lake type sampled, including Actinobacteria in polymictic lakes (i.e., lakes with multiple mixing events per year), Methylophilales in dimictic lakes (lakes with two mixing events per year, usually in spring and fall), and “Candidatus Omnitrophica” in meromictic lakes (lakes with no recorded mixing events). The community present during each year at each site was also surprisingly unique. Despite unexpected interannual variability in community composition, we detected a core community of taxa found in all lakes and layers, including Actinobacteria tribe acI-B2 and Betaprotobacteria lineage PnecC. Although trends in abundance did not repeat annually, each freshwater lineage within the communities had a consistent lifestyle, defined by persistence, abundance, and variability. The results of our analysis emphasize the importance of long-term multisite observations, as analyzing only a single year of data or one lake would not have allowed us to describe the dynamics and composition of these freshwater bacterial communities to the extent presented here. IMPORTANCE Lakes are excellent systems for investigating bacterial community dynamics because they have clear boundaries and strong environmental gradients. The results of our research demonstrate that bacterial community composition varies by year, a finding which likely applies to other ecosystems and has implications for study design and interpretation. Understanding the drivers and controls of bacterial communities on long time scales would improve both our knowledge of fundamental properties of bacterial communities and our ability to predict community states. In this specific ecosystem, bog lakes play a disproportionately large role in global carbon cycling, and the information presented here may ultimately help refine carbon budgets for these lakes. Finally, all data and code in this study are publicly available. We hope that this will serve as a resource for anyone seeking to answer their own microbial ecology questions using a multiyear time series.","2017-06","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-07-19 17:40:22","","","","3","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adult survivors of childhood ALL are at increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic illnesses. We hypothesize that ALL therapy is associated with long-term gut microbiome alterations that contribute to predisposition to chronic medical conditions. We conducted a pilot study to test whether differences can be detected between stool microbiota of pediatric ALL survivors and their siblings. Stool samples were collected from 38 individuals under age 19 who were at least 1 year after completion of therapy for ALL. Stool samples collected from 16 healthy siblings served as controls. 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on the stool samples. Comparing microbiota of survivors to sibling controls, no statistically significant differences were found in alpha or beta diversity. However, among the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from component 1 in sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) with different relative abundance in survivors versus siblings, OTUs mapping to the genus Faecalibacterium were depleted in survivors. Differences in gut microbial composition were found between pediatric survivors of childhood ALL and their siblings. Specifically, the protective Faecalibacterium is depleted in survivors, which is reminiscent of gut microbiota alteration found in adult survivors of childhood ALL and reported in obesity, suggesting that microbiota alterations in pediatric ALL survivors start in childhood and may play a role in predisposition to chronic illness in later years of survivorship.","2020-08-17","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-30 18:31:43","","475-488","","6","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Principal coordinate analysis of beta diversity measures was used for visualization. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm and Wilcoxon test were used to differentiate the microbiomes found in the fetal membranes and cord blood in the cases of preterm birth. Results: OTU analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene showed similar microbiomes in the maternal peripheral blood, amniotic fluid, fetal membranes, and cord blood.

Despite microbes' importance in plants, seeds are mostly sterile, and most plant microbes are recruited from an environmental pool. Surprisingly little is known about the processes that govern how environmental microbes assemble on plants in nature. In this study we examine how bacteria are distributed across plant parts, and how these distributions interact with spatial gradients. We sequenced amplicons of bacteria from the surfaces of six plant parts and adjacent soil of Scaevola taccada, a common beach shrub, along a 60 km transect spanning O'ahu island's windward coast, as well as within a single intensively-sampled site. Bacteria are more strongly partitioned by plant part as compared with location. Within S. taccada plants, microbial communities are highly nested: soil and rhizosphere communities contain much of the diversity found elsewhere, whereas reproductive parts fall at the bottom of the nestedness hierarchy. Nestedness patterns suggest either that microbes follow a source/sink gradient from the ground up, or else that assembly processes correlate with other traits, such as tissue persistence, that are vertically stratified.

Conservation tillage is extensively used in northern China, which alters the soil structure and nutrient conditions, causing changes in the soil microbial community. However, the influence of conservation tillage on rhizosphere bacteria during plant growth, and associations with plant root nutrient efficiency, and plant productivity remains unclear, particularly regarding the effects on the stability of the soil bacterial community that modifies plant growth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the contributions of conservation (chisel plow, zero) tillage and conventional (plow) tillage on the soil rhizosphere bacterial community throughout plant growth. The responses and succession of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of winter wheat crops growing under conservation and conventional tillage practices were determined through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA. The response of plant growth was determined by measuring plant carbon and nitrogen accumulation from the wheat tillering stage to the flowering stage. Here, we show that variations in rhizosphere alpha and beta diversity throughout plant growth had the greatest contributions to distinguishing conventional plow tillage from conservation (chisel plow, zero) tillage. Additionally, zero tillage (dissimilarity: 11.3%) had less of an effect on the relative abundances of Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-) and Bacteroidetes in the rhizosphere in response to plant growth as compared with plow tillage (dissimilarity: 21.7%). This is the first in-depth study of the effects of conservation and conventional tillage on the stability of rhizosphere bacterial community in response to plant growth. Furthermore, our study indicates that conservation tillage can modify the soil conditions and preserve rhizosphere bacterial memberships. The consequent enhanced stability of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria population can help to establish a profitable agroecosystem to in turn enhance soil nutrient conditions and improve plant production sustainably.","2017-10","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-07-19 19:24:34","","","","5","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-plant; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, an effect on depression has already been suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms. Ruminococcus gauvreauii and Coprococcus 3 were more abundant and beta-diversity was higher in the probiotics group after 28 days. KEGG-analysis showed elevated inflammation-regulatory and metabolic pathways in the intervention group. The elevated abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria after probiotic treatment allows speculations on the functionality of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Furthermore, the finding of upregulated vitamin B6 and B7 synthesis underlines the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental health through the regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Concluding, four-week probiotic plus biotin supplementation, in inpatient individuals with a major depressive disorder diagnosis, showed an overall beneficial effect of clinical treatment. However, probiotic intervention compared to placebo only differed in microbial diversity profile, not in clinical outcome measures.","2020-11","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-07-19 17:14:37","","","","11","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-disorder; var-gut-brain axis; var-probiotics; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extreme environmental changes during captivity may influence survival ability in the wild. Captivity decreases gut bacterial diversity in a wide range of animals. However, most studies directly compare animals living in captivity with those in the wild, and there is a lack of understanding of effects of gradient shift in lifestyle during species reintroduction based on the soft-release strategy, which involves a confinement period in a field enclosure. Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze gut microbiomes of 11 captive and 12 semi-wild Przewalski's horses (PH; Equus ferus przewalskii) under the same captivity environment, using fecal samples. A subset of samples with abundant extracted DNA (including 3 captive and 3 semi-wild individuals) was selected for whole-genome shotgun sequencing. We found that community diversity did not differ between the semi-wild PH and captive PH, but the semi-wild PH had significantly higher bacterial richness than those in captivity. Relative abundances of all dominant phyla were similar across the semi-wild or captive horses, while those of the non-dominant phyla Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were significantly higher in semi-wild PH than in captive PH. Beta diversity results indicated that bacterial communities of captives and semi-wild horses were clearly separated distinct when considering only composition. Functional profiling of the microbiomes revealed that the semi-wild and captive gut microbiomes were largely similar. However, semi-wild horse microbiomes had higher abundance of bacterial genes related to core metabolic processes, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleic acid metabolism. The study revealed that semi-wild PH could retain specific non-dominant bacteria and harbor a more diverse microbiome than the captive counterpart, and thus have higher metabolic potential to utilize the complex plants efficiently. These results indicate that change in host lifestyle may play a role in microbiome differentiation in the process of reintroduction, suggesting that a short period of time in captivity is acceptable for PH from the perspective of maintaining the richness of intestinal bacterial flora to some extent.","2020-03-12","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-07-18 22:03:17","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; shotgun sequencing; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Biological invasions have been shown to be linked to the genetic properties of alien host species. It is thus plausible that the holobiont, the host, and its associated microbiome act as an entity to drive invasion success. The bighead carp and silver carp (bigheaded carps), invasive species that exhibit extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), provided a unique model to test the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. Here, we investigated the microbiomes of foreguts and hindguts in bigheaded carps and their reciprocal hybrids reared in aquaculture ponds using 16S amplicons and the associated gene prediction. We found an admixed pattern in the gut microbiome community in bigheaded carp hybrids. The hybrid gut microbiomes showed special characteristics such as relatively high alpha diversity in the foregut, an increasing dissimilarity between foreguts and hindguts, and a remarkable proportion of genes coding for putative enzymes related to their digestion of main food resources (Cyanobacteria, cellulose, and chitin). The pond-reared hybrids had advantageous features in genes coding for putative enzymes related to their diet. The above results collectively suggested that the gut microbiomes of hybrids could be beneficial to their local adaptation (e.g., food resource utilization), which might have facilitated their invasion in the MRB. The gut microbial findings, along with the intrinsic genomic features likely associated with life-history traits revealed in our recent study, provide preliminary evidence supporting the holobiont hypothesis of invasion.","2021-03","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-30 19:23:15","","735-745","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; beta diversity; biome-fish gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We characterized the composition and functional potential of the gut microbiota in 48 individuals with chronic schizophrenia and 48 matched (sequencing plate, age, sex, BMI, and antibiotic use) non-psychiatric comparison subjects (NCs) using 16S rRNA sequencing. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrated significant beta-diversity differences in microbial composition and predicted genetic functional potential compared to NCs.

Random forests analyses revealed that the microbiome predicts differentiation of patients with schizophrenia from NCs using taxa (75% accuracy) and functional profiles (67% accuracy for KEGG orthologs, 70% for MetaCyc pathways). We utilized a new compositionally-aware method incorporating reference frames to identify differentially abundant microbes and pathways, which revealed that Lachnospiraceae is associated with schizophrenia. Functional pathways related to trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase and Kdo(2)-lipid A biosynthesis were altered in schizophrenia.

In this study, we used light-dependent oxic-anoxic micro-ecosystems to understand how the functioning and diversity of aerobic and anaerobic lake analog communities are affected by a pulse light deprivation. Continuous measurements of oxygen concentration were made and a time series of full-length 16S rRNA sequencing was used to quantify changes in alpha- and beta diversity. In the upper oxic layer, oxygen concentration decreased significantly under light reduction, but showed resilience in daily mean, minimum, and maximum after light conditions were restored to control level. Only the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in oxygen concentrations did not recover fully, and instead tended to remain lower in treated ecosystems. Alpha diversity of the upper oxic layer communities showed a delayed increase after light conditions were restored, and was not resilient in the longer term. In contrast, alpha diversity of the anoxic lower layer communities increased during the light reduction, but was resilient in the longer term. Community composition changed significantly during light reduction, and showed resilience in the oxic layer and lack of resilience in the anoxic layer. Alpha diversity and the amplitude of daily oxygen fluctuations within and among treatments were strongly correlated, suggesting that higher diversity could lead to less variable oxygen concentrations, or vice versa. Our experiment showed that light deprivation induces multifaceted responses of community function (oxygen respiration) and structure, hence focusing on a single stability component could potentially be misleading.","2022-04","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-07-19 17:32:34","","","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-microbial colonies; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to identify metabolic and microbiome perturbations in feces that are associated with consumption of a medium chain triglyceride ketogenic diet (MCT-KD) in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to generate microbiome profiles and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to generate lipidomic profiles of canine feces. We made comparisons between the MCT-KD, standardized placebo diet and baseline pre-trial diet phases. Consumption of the MCT-KD resulted in a significant increase in the species richness (alpha-diversity) of bacterial communities found in the feces when compared to the baseline diet. However, phylogenetical diversity between samples (beta-diversity) was not affected by diet. An unnamed Bacteroidaceae species within genus 5-7N15 was identified by LEfSe as a potential biomarker associated with consumption of the MCT-KD, showing an increased abundance (p = 0.005, q = 0.230) during consumption of MCT-KD. In addition, unclassified members of families Erysipelotrichaceae (p = 0.013, q = 0.335) and Fusobacteriaceae (p = 0.022, q = 0.358) were significantly increased during MCT-KD consumption compared to baseline. Blautia sp. and Megamonas sp. instead were decreased during consumption of either placebo or MCT-KD (p = 0.045, q = 0.449, and p = 0.039, q = 0.449, respectively). Bacteroidaceae, including genus 5-7N15, have previously been associated with non-aggressive behavior in dogs. In addition, 5-7N15 is correlated in humans with Akkermansia, a genus known to be involved in the neuroprotective effect of ketogenic diets in mice models of seizures. Five metabolite features, tentatively identified as long chain triglycerides, were significantly higher after consumption of the placebo diet, but no unique features were identified after consumption of the MCT-KD. The data presented in this study highlight significant changes shown in both the fecal microbiome and lipidome as a result of consumption of the MCT-KD. Elucidating the global canine gut response to MCT consumption will improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms which confer anti-seizure and behavior modulating effects. Further studies should aim to characterize the gut microbiome of both dogs with epilepsy and healthy controls.","2020-12-22","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-07-19 18:01:40","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-canine gut; var-diet; var-disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE To examine associations of gut microbiome composition with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in a large population-based setting controlling for various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional analysis included 2166 participants from 2 Dutch population-based prospective cohorts: the Rotterdam Study and the LifeLines-DEEP study. EXPOSURES The 16S ribosomal RNA method was used to measure microbiome composition in stool samples collected between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013. The alpha diversity (Shannon, richness, and Inverse Simpson indexes), beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix), and taxa (from domain to genus level) were identified to reflect gut microbiome composition. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Associations among alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxa with the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and with type 2 diabetes were examined. Glucose and insulin were measured to calculate the HOMA-IR. Type 2 diabetes cases were identified based on glucose levels and medical records from January 2012 to December 2013. Analyses were adjusted for technical covariates, lifestyle, sociodemographic, and medical factors. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. RESULTS There were 2166 participants in this study: 1418 from the Rotterdam Study (mean [SD] age, 62.4 [5.9] years; 815 [57.5%] male) and 748 from the LifeLines-DEEP study (mean [SD] age, 44.7 [13.4] years; 431 [57.6%] male); from this total, 193 type 2 diabetes cases were identified. Lower microbiome Shannon index and richness were associated with higher HOMA-IR (eg, Shannon index, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02), and patients with type 2 diabetes had a lower richness than participants without diabetes (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99). The beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix) was associated with insulin resistance (R-2 = 0.004, P = .001 in the Rotterdam Study and R-2 = 0.005, P = .002 in the LifeLines-DEEP study). A total of 12 groups of bacteria were associated with HOMA-IR or type 2 diabetes. Specifically, a higher abundance of Christensenellaceae (beta = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.03: P < .001), Christensenellaceae R7 group (beta = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.03; P < .001), Marvinbryantia (beta = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.03; P < .001), Ruminococcaceae UCG005 (beta = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.05; P < .001), Ruminococcaceae UCG008 (beta = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.11 to -0.03; P < .001), Ruminococcaceae UCG010 (beta = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.04; P < .001), or Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group (beta = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.05; P < .001) was associated with lower HOMA-IR. A higher abundance of Clostridiaceae 1 (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.41-0.65; P < .001), Peptostreptococcaceae (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45-0.70; P < .001), C sensu stricto 1 (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.40-0.65; P < .001), Intestinibacter (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.48-0.76; P < .001), or Romboutsia (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44-0.70; P < .001) was associated with less type 2 diabetes. These bacteria are all known to produce butyrate. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, higher microbiome alpha diversity, along with more butyrate-producing gut bacteria, was associated with less type 2 diabetes and with lower insulin resistance among individuals without diabetes.

The benefits of fiber are partially attributed to modulation of the gut microbiota, whose composition and function depend on the amount and quality of microbiota-accessible substrates in the diet. However, not all types of fiber are equally accessible to the gut microbiota. Phaseolus vulgaris L., or common bean, is a food type rich in fiber as well as other prebiotics posing a great potential to positively impact diet-microbiota-host interactions. To elucidate the magnitude of bean's effects on the gut microbiota, increasing doses of common bean were administered in macronutrient-matched diet formulations. The microbial communities in the ceca of female and male mice were evaluated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. As the bean dose increased, the Bacillota:Bacteroidota ratio (formerly referred to as the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio) was reduced and alpha-diversity decreased, whereas the community composition was distinctly different between the diet groups according to beta-diversity. These effects were more pronounced in female mice compared to male mice. Compositional analyses identified a dose-responsive bean-induced shift in microbial composition. With an increasing bean dose, Rikenellaceae, Bacteroides, and RF39, which are associated with health benefits, were enhanced. More taxa, however, were suppressed, among which were Allobaculum, Oscillospira, Dorea, and Ruminococcus, which are predominantly associated with chronic disease risk. Investigation of the origins of the dose dependent and biological sex differences in response to common bean consumption may provide insights into bean-gut microbiota-host interactions important to developing food-based precision approaches to chronic disease prevention and control.","2022-04","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-30 20:19:49","","","","8","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bacterial community structure and functionality remain mostly uncharacterized for arctic WSPs, yet are presumed important for treatment outcomes during the 3-month summer treatment season with open water in the WSPs. The objective of this study was to investigate treatment performance and related temporal and spatial changes in the structure and putative function of bacterial communities during treatment of municipal wastewater in the WSPs of Pond Inlet and Clyde River, Nunavut over two consecutive summer treatment seasons. Influent raw wastewater contained a high organic load and large bacterial communities (similar to 9 log 16S rRNA copies/mL) belonging mainly to Proteobacteria. Although designed to be facultative ponds, both WSPs remained anaerobic with neutral pH values (7.5-7.8) throughout the summer treatment season. Water quality data showed that nutrients [measured as carbonaceous biological oxygen demand (CBOD5)], total suspended solids, and total ammonia nitrogen were progressively reduced during treatment in the ponds as the summer progressed. The pond bacterial population size and species richness depended on the pond temperature (2-18 degrees C), with 8.5 log 16S rRNA copies/mL and the largest alpha diversities (Shannon-Wiener index of 4-4.5) observed mid-season (late July). While the phylogenetic beta diversity in raw wastewater from the two locations remained similar, pond bacterial communities underwent significant (p < 0.05) changes to dominance of Comamonadaceae, Geobacteracea, and Porphyromonadaceae. Multivariate distance based redundancy analysis and predicted gene functionalities in the microbiota agreed with water quality results that microbial removal of nutrients (e.g., CBOD5) peaked in the middle of the summer coinciding with the treatment period with the highest pond temperatures. Information from this study will be useful for further development of models to predict biological treatment outcomes, which could be used to size and assess the feasibility of WSPs in extreme climates. Higher pond temperatures resulted in optimal biological processes and nutrient removal in the middle of the summer. While it is challenging to control environmental factors in a passive wastewater treatment system there are some design considerations that could be used to optimize temperature regimes, such as the depth of the pond.","2021-08-20","2022-06-27 16:29:05","2022-06-30 21:02:14","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-environmental; var-temperature; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, how nutritional factors shape the initial colonization of gut bacteria in infants, especially in preterm infants, is still not completely known. In this study, we compared the effects of feeding with mothers' own breast milk (MBM) and formula on the initial composition and gene expression of gut bacteria in moderate-late preterm infants. Fecal samples were collected from ten formula-fed and ten MBM healthy infants born between 32 and 37 weeks' gestation after they reached full-volume enteral feedings. Total DNAs were extracted from fecal samples for amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and total RNA with rRNA depletion for metatranscriptome RNA-Seq 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing results showed that the alpha-diversity was similar between the MBM- and formula-fed preterm infants, but the beta-diversity showed a significant difference in composition (p = 0.002). The most abundant taxa were Veillonella (18.4%) and Escherichia/Shigella (15.2%) in MBM infants, whereas the most abundant taxa of formula-fed infants were Streptococcus (18.6%) and Klebsiella (17.4%). The genera Propionibacterium, Streptococcus, and Finegoldia and order Clostridiales had significantly higher relative abundance in the MBM group than the formula group, whereas bacteria under family Enterobacteriaceae, genera Enterococcus and Veillonella, and class Bacilli were more abundant in the formula group. In general, microbiomes from both diet groups exhibited high functional levels of catalytic activity and metabolic processing when analyzed for gene ontology using a comparative metatranscriptome approach. Statistically, the microbial genes in the MBM group had an upregulation in expression related to glycine reductase, periplasmic acid stress response in Enterobacteria, acid resistance mechanisms, and L-fucose utilization. In contrast, the formula-fed group had upregulations in genes associated with methionine and valine degradation functions. Our data suggest that the nutritional source plays a role in shaping the moderate-late preterm gut microbiome as evidenced by the differences in bacterial composition and gene expression profiles in the fecal samples.

However, most of our current knowledge about the hibernator gut microbiota is derived from studies using captive animals. Given that there are substantial differences between captive and wild environments, conclusions drawn from studies with captive hibernators may not reflect the gut microbiota's role in the physiology of wild animals. To address this, we used Illumina-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to compare the bacterial cecal microbiotas of captive and wild 13-lined ground squirrels (TLGS) in the summer. As the first study to use Illumina-based technology to compare the microbiotas of an obligate rodent hibernator across the year, we also reported changes in captive TLGS microbiotas in summer, winter, and spring. Results Wild TLGS microbiotas had greater richness and phylogenetic diversity with less variation in beta diversity when compared to captive microbiotas. Taxa identified as core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and found to significantly contribute to differences in beta diversity were primarily in the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Captive TLGS microbiotas shared phyla and core OTUs across the year, but active season (summer and spring) microbiotas had different alpha and beta diversities than winter season microbiotas. Conclusions This is the first study to compare the microbiotas of captive and wild rodent hibernators. Our findings suggest that data from captive and wild ground squirrels should be interpreted separately due to their distinct microbiotas. Additionally, as the first study to compare seasonal microbiotas of obligate rodent hibernators using Illumina-based 16S rRNA sequencing, we reported changes in captive TLGS microbiotas that are consistent with previous work. Taken together, this study provides foundational information for improving the reproducibility and experimental design of future hibernation microbiota studies.","2022-01-03","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-07-19 15:28:55","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-squirrel gut; var-longitudinal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R.","Intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence on an omnivore's gut microbiome","PLOS ONE","","","10.1371/journal.pone.0266698","","Gut microbiomes (GMBs), complex communities of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tracts of their hosts, perform countless micro-ecosystem services such as facilitating energy uptake and modulating immune responses. While scientists increasingly recognize the role GMBs play in host health, the role of GMBs in wildlife ecology and conservation has yet to be realized fully. Here, we use brown bears (Ursus arctos) as an ecological model to (1) characterize GMB community composition associated with location, season, and reproductive condition of a large omnivore; (2) investigate how both extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence GMB community membership and structure; and (3) quantify differences in GMB communities among different locations, seasons, sex, and reproductive conditions. To achieve these aims, we subsampled brown bear fecal samples collected during United States National Park Service research activities at three National Parks and Preserves (Katmai, Lake Clark, and Gates of the Arctic) and extracted microbial DNA for 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and microbial taxonomic classification. We analyzed GMB communities using alpha and beta diversity indices, subsequently using linear mixed models to examine relationships between alpha diversity and extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Katmai brown bears hosted the greatest alpha diversity, whereas Gates brown bears hosted the least alpha diversity. Our results indicate that location and diet drive GMB variation, with bears hosting less phylogenetic diversity as park distance inland increases. Monitoring brown bear GMBs could enable managers to quickly detect and assess the impact of environmental perturbations on brown bear health. By integrating macro and micro-ecological perspectives we aim to inform local and landscape-level management decisions to promote long-term brown bear conservation and management.","2022","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 17:02:16","","","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In women, studies have also shown that during pregnancy there is a reduction in bacterial species richness in the gut. In the current experiment rats were used to model the interaction of diet, reproductive status, and intestinal bacterial microbiota during pregnancy and lactation. In Experiment 1 rats were exposed to either standard chow or high-fat chow (60%) and were divided into two groups: unmated (NULL) or mated (RE). In Experiment 2, both NULL and RE rats were exposed to high-fat chow for a 30-day period. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that pregnancy impacted the gut microbiota in a similar manner to humans. The impact of reproductive status on microbiota composition, however, was stronger in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet. Diet-induced changes replicated some of the changes observed in humans, such as increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. However, in contrast to humans, pregnancy in rats did not increase beta-diversity between microbiota from different animals. These results indicate that during pregnancy in rats, the gut microbiota is altered in a similar manner to that which occurs in women, and that these changes are further exaggerated by exposure to a HF diet. Thus, the rat may allow modelling the effects of consumption of HF food during pregnancy and enable future studies to determine the risks of HF diets during pregnancy and its consequences on the offspring.","2018","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-07-19 17:27:49","","143-154","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the microbiota from most livestock species has not yet been studied. Goats are seasonal breeders, but semen microbiota has never been described in this species, and it is unknown how seasonality affects it. Our study objective is 2-fold: to describe the microbiota in goat buck ejaculates and to determine if it differs between breeding and non-breeding seasons. Semen from six males of the Murciano-Granadina breed was collected during both seasons. Two replicates were performed per male and season on different days. The microbiota was characterized by genomic sequencing technology. Sperm quality was also evaluated. Repetition was not significant for the studied variables. Sperm velocities were higher for the breeding than for the non-breeding season. The ejaculates from both seasons also differed in the proportion of apoptotic spermatozoa. The five dominant phyla were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes during the breeding season and Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria during the non-breeding season. The dominant genus during both seasons was Ureaplasma. Differences in microbial community structure (the beta diversity) were found. A decrease in the relative abundance of the genus Faecalibacterium and an increase in the genera Sphingomonas and Halomonas were observed in the ejaculates collected during the breeding season. Sphingomonas and Faecalibacterium abundance favorably and unfavorably correlated with sperm quality, respectively. In conclusion, the semen microbiota from goat bucks varies between breeding and non-breeding seasons, and the microbiota remains stable for 7 days within a season. In addition, the genera Sphingomonas and Faecalibacterium could be possible biomarkers of semen quality in goat bucks. These results contribute to an in-depth understanding of the effects of reproductive seasonality on goat buck ejaculates.","2022-05-13","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 19:47:11","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-goat semen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assess the contribution of diet in explaining urban-rural variation in gut microbiota, we performed an aviary experiment in which urban and rural house sparrows were fed with mimics of urban or rural diets. Before the experiment, rural sparrows hosted more diverse gut communities, with a higher relative abundance of Enterococcaceae and Staphylococcaceae and lower abundance of genes involved in xenobiotic degradation and lipid metabolism than their urban counterparts. The experimental diets significantly altered gut microbiota alpha- and beta-diversity and taxonomic composition, with the strongest shifts occurring in individuals exposed to contrasting diets. Overall, diet-induced shifts resembled initial differences between free-ranging urban and rural hosts. Furthermore, rural diet had a positive impact on urban host body mass but only in hosts with the highest initial gut diversity. Overall, our results indicate that diet constitutes an important factor contributing to differences in gut microbiota along the urbanization gradient and provide new insights on possible fitness consequences of a reduced gut diversity in urban settings.","2020-02-12","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 20:52:35","","","","1920","287","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-bird gut; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brangus heifers (n = 78) underwent a 7-d Co-Synch + controlled internal drug release estrus synchronization protocol. At AI, a double-guarded uterine culture swab was used to sample the anterior vaginal tract. Immediately after swabbing the vaginal tract, blood samples were collected by coccygeal venipuncture to determine concentrations of estradiol. Heifers were retrospectively classified as pregnant (n = 29) vs. nonpregnant (n = 49) between 41 and 57 d post-AI. Additionally, heifers were classified into low (1.1 to 2.5 pg/mL; n = 21), medium (2.6 to 6.7 pg/mL; n = 30), and high (7.2 to 17.6 pg/mL; n = 27) concentration of estradiol. The vaginal bacterial community composition was determined through sequencing of the V4 region from the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina Miseq platform. Alpha diversity was compared via ANOVA and beta diversity was compared via PERMANOVA. There were no differences in the Shannon diversity index (alpha diversity; P = 0.336) or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (beta diversity; P = 0.744) of pregnant vs. nonpregnant heifers. Overall, bacterial community composition in heifers with high, medium, or low concentrations of estradiol did not differ (P = 0.512). While no overall compositional differences were observed, species-level differences were present within pregnancy status and estradiol concentration groups. The implications of these species-level differences are unknown, but these differences could alter the vaginal environment thereby influencing fertility and vaginal health. Therefore, species-level changes could provide better insight rather than overall microbial composition in relation to an animal's reproductive health.","2020-06","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 19:34:44","","","","6","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle vagina; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dyspareunia is a relevant symptom of patients with vulvodynia. Vaginal microbiome has known an important role in local immune-inflammatory responses and it may be important pathogenic mechanism in vulvodynia. Aim: The objective of this study was to investigate the association of vaginal microbiome and vulvodynia. Methods: We analyzed the microbial compositions of the vestibule and vagina among women with clinically diagnosed vulvodynia (n = 22) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 22) without vulvodynia. The compositions of bacterial microbiomes were compared by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA. Main outcome measure: Vaginal microbiome alpha and beta diversity were assessed using the Shannon diversity index and Heat map. Linear discriminant analysis effect size was used to find out marker for vulvodynia. Results: There were no significant differences in the age, duration of marriage, history of gynecologic surgery, parity, and menopause status between cases and controls. A total of 1,661,934 high-quality pyrosequencing reads was obtained to evaluate bacterial diversity, and 50,246 unique sequences represented all phylotypes. The type and mean number of the genera were not different between cases and controls. However, the most predominant phyla of bacteria were significantly different between cases and controls. 3 phyla (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Tenericutes) and 11 genera including Gardnerella, Ureaplasma, Achromobacter, Mycoplasma, and Bifidobacteria were significantly more prevalent in cases than in controls (P < .05). Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis suggest the Bifidobacterium, Mycoplasma, and Fenollaria species can be potential markers for vulvodynia. Conclusion: Our results suggest the differences in vaginal microbiome can be associated with the vulvodynia. Copyright (C) 2020, The Authors.

Soil microbes play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem stability and function (e.g., nitrogen cycling). However, the response of bacterial community composition and community-level function to soil salinity remains uncertain. Here, we used multiple statistical analyses to assess the effect of high salinity on bacterial community composition and potential metabolism function in the agricultural ecosystem. Results showed that high salinity significantly altered both bacterial alpha (Shannon-Wiener index and phylogenetic diversity) and beta diversity. Salinity, total nitrogen (TN), and soil organic matter (SOM) were the vital environmental factors shaping bacterial community composition. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes decreased with salinity, whereas Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased with salinity. The modularity and the ratio of negative to positive links remarkedly decreased, indicating that high salinity destabilized bacterial networks. Variable selection, which belongs to deterministic processes, mediated bacterial community assembly within the saline soils. Function prediction results showed that the key nitrogen metabolism (e.g., ammonification, nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification processes) was inhibited in high salinity habitats. MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the abundance and composition of the nitrifying community were influenced by high salinity. The consistency of function prediction and experimental verification demonstrated that high salinity inhibited soil bacterial community mediating nitrogen cycling. Our study provides strong evidence for a salinity effect on the bacterial community composition and key metabolism function, which could help us understand how soil microbes respond to ongoing environment perturbation. IMPORTANCE Revealing the response of the soil bacterial community to external environmental disturbances is an important but poorly understood topic in microbial ecology. In this study, we evaluated the effect of high salinity on the bacterial community composition and key biogeochemical processes in salinized agricultural soils (0.22 to 19.98 dS m(-1)). Our results showed that high salinity significantly decreased bacterial diversity, altered bacterial community composition, and destabilized the bacterial network. Moreover, variable selection (61% to 66%) mediated bacterial community assembly within the saline soils. Functional prediction combined with microbiological verification proved that high salinity inhibited soil bacterial community mediating nitrogen turnover. Understanding the impact of salinity on soil bacterial community is of great significance for managing saline soils and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.","2021-11","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-07-19 19:15:41","","","","21","87","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-salinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some recent research has investigated alternative sampling methods to overcome this issue. The main goal of this study was to assess to what extent the microbial composition of non-invasive samples (excreta, litter and poultry dust) are representative of invasive samples (caecal and ileal contents). The microbiota of excreta, dust, litter, caecal and ileal contents (n = 110) was assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. Of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in caecal contents, 99.7% were also detected in dust, 98.6% in litter and 100% in excreta. Of the OTUs detected in ileal contents, 99.8% were detected in dust, 99.3% in litter and 95.3% in excreta. Although the majority of the OTUs found in invasive samples were detected in non-invasive samples, the relative abundance of members of the microbial communities of these groups were different, as shown by beta diversity measures. Under the conditions of this study, correlation analysis showed that dust could be used as a proxy for ileal and caecal contents to detect the abundance of the phylum Firmicutes, and excreta as a proxy of caecal contents for the detection of Tenericutes. Similarly, litter could be used as a proxy for caecal contents to detect the abundance of Firmicutes and Tenericutes. However, none of the non-invasive samples could be used to infer the overall abundance of OTUs observed in invasive samples. In conclusion, non-invasive samples could be used to detect the presence and absence of the majority of the OTUs found in invasive samples, but could not accurately reflect the microbial community structure of invasive samples.","2021-08-05","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 17:02:43","","","","8","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emerging evidence have demonstrated that gut dysbiosis contributes to the pathophysiology or exacerbation of ocular diseases including dry eye disease. However, the relationship between aging-related changes in gut microbiota and dry eye disease has not been elucidated. In this pilot study, we investigated the association between aging-dependent microbiome changes and dry eye severity in C57BL/6 male mice. Results Eight-week-old (8 W, n = 15), one-year-old (1Y, n = 10), and two-year-old (2Y, n = 8) C57BL/6 male mice were used. Dry eye severity was assessed by corneal staining scores and tear secretion.

Here, we investigated whether oral inoculation of laying hens with feces of wild ducks (mallards, Anas platyrhynchos) resulted in a hen fecal microbiome that was detectably altered on community parameters or relative abundances of individual genera. To distinguish between effects of the duck inoculum and effects of the inoculation procedure, we compared the fecal microbiomes of adult laying hens resulting from 3 treatments: inoculation with wild duck feces (duck), inoculation with chicken feces (auto), and a negative control group with no treatment. We collected cloacal swabs from 7 hens per treatment before (day 0), and 2 and 7 D after inoculation, and performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. No distinguishable effect of inoculation with duck feces on microbiome community (alpha and beta diversity) was found compared to auto or control treatments. At the individual taxonomic level, the relative abundance of the genus Alistipes (phylum Bacteroidetes) was significantly higher in the inoculated treatments (auto and duck) compared to the control 2 D after inoculation. Seven days after inoculation, the relative abundance of Alistipes had increased in the control and no effect was found anymore across treatments. These effects might be explained by the perturbation of the hen's microbiome caused by the inoculation procedure itself, or by intrinsic temporal variation in the hen's microbiome. This experiment shows that a single inoculation of fecal microbiota from duck feces to laying hens did not cause a measurable alteration of the gut microbiome community. Furthermore, the temporary change in relative abundance for Alistipes could not be attributed to the duck feces inoculation. These outcomes suggest that the fecal microbiome of adult laying hens may not be a useful indicator for detection of single oral exposure to wild duck feces.","2019-12","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-07-18 22:02:22","","6542-6551","","12","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-duck gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rhizosphere surrounding the coralloid root serves as a reservoir and source of mostly diazotroph and plant growth-promoting groups that colonize the coralloid endosphere. In the case of cyanobacteria, the endosphere is enriched with Nostoc spp and Calothrix spp that are closely related to previously reported symbiont genera in cycads and other early divergent plants. The data reported here provide an in-depth taxonomic characterization of the bacterial community associated with coralloid root microbiome. The functional aspects of the endophytes, their biological interactions, and their evolutionary history are the next research step in this recently discovered diversity within the cycad coralloid root microbiome.","2019-02-06","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 17:04:38","","","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design and setting A nested case-control study within two prospective cohort studies, the Shanghai Women's Health Study (n=74 941) and the Shanghai Men's Health Study (n=61 480). Participants Lifetime never-smokers who had no cancer at baseline. Cases were subjects who were diagnosed with incident lung cancer (n=114) and were matched 1:1 with controls on sex, age (<= 2 years), date (<= 30 days) and time (morning/afternoon) of sample collection, antibiotic use during the week before sample collection (yes/no) and menopausal status (for women). Main outcomes and measures Metagenomic shotgun sequencing was used to measure the community structure and abundance of the oral microbiome in pre-diagnostic oral rinse samples of each case and control. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of lung cancer risk with alpha diversity metrics and relative abundance of taxa. The Microbiome Regression-Based Kernel Association Test (MiRKAT) evaluated the association between risk and the microbiome beta diversity. Results Subjects with lower microbiota alpha diversity had an increased risk of lung cancer compared with those with higher microbial alpha diversity (Shannon: p(trend)=0.05; Simpson: p(trend)=0.04; Observed Species: p(trend)=0.64). No case-control differences were apparent for beta diversity (p(MiRKAT)=0.30). After accounting for multiple comparisons, a greater abundance of Spirochaetia (ORlow 1.00 (reference), ORmedium 0.61 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.18), ORhigh 0.42 (95% CI 0.21 to 0.85)) and Bacteroidetes (ORlow 1.00 (reference), ORmedium 0.66 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.25), ORhigh 0.31 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.64)) was associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer, while a greater abundance of the Bacilli class (ORlow 1.00 (reference), ORmedium 1.49 (95% CI 0.73 to 3.08), ORhigh 2.40 (95% CI 1.18 to 4.87)) and Lactobacillales order (ORlow 1.00 (reference), ORmedium 2.15 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.47), ORhigh 3.26 (95% CI 1.58 to 6.70)) was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Conclusions Our prospective study of never-smokers suggests that lower alpha diversity was associated with a greater risk of lung cancer and the abundance of certain specific taxa was associated with altered risk, providing further insight into the aetiology of lung cancer in the absence of active tobacco smoking.","2021-03","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-06-30 17:56:11","","256-263","","3","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","shotgun sequencing; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether the perturbed microbiota community is restored after disease remission and cessation of cancer treatment has not been evaluated. This study examines the chronological changes of gut microbiota in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to the start-, during-, and following cessation of chemotherapy.MethodologyWe conducted a longitudinal observational study in gut microbiota profile in a group of paediatric patients diagnosed with ALL using 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing and compared these patients' microbiota pattern with age and ethnicity-matched healthy children. Temporal changes of gut microbiota in these patients with ALL were also examined at different time-points in relation to chemotherapy.ResultsPrior to commencement of chemotherapy, gut microbiota in children with ALL had larger inter-individual variability compared to healthy controls and was enriched with bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes phylum and Bacteroides genus. The relative abundance of Bacteroides decreased upon commencement of chemotherapy. Restitution of gut microbiota composition to resemble that of healthy controls occurred after cessation of chemotherapy. However, the microbiota composition (beta diversity) remained distinctive and a few bacteria were different in abundance among the patients with ALL compared to controls despite completion of chemotherapy and presumed restoration of normal health.ConclusionOur findings in this pilot study is the first to suggest that gut microbiota profile in children with ALL remains marginally different from healthy controls even after cessation of chemotherapy. These persistent microbiota changes may have a role in the long-term wellbeing in childhood cancer survivors but the impact of these changes in subsequent health perturbations in these survivors remain unexplored.","2020-02-24","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-07-19 18:05:30","","","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-longitudinal; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though the relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and CDI is well known, it is unclear whether different forms of dysbiosis may potentially affect the course of CDI. How this is further influenced by C. difficile-directed antibiotics is virtually uninvestigated. In this study, diarrhea! stool samples were collected from 20 hospitalized patients, half of whom were confirmed to have CDI. Analyzing tissue ex vivo and in duplicate, CDI and non-CDI fecal samples (n = 176) were either not antibiotic treated or treated with metronidazole, vancomycin, or fidaxomicin, the three most common CDI therapies. The microbial community composition, interactions, and predicted metabolic functions were assessed by 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer sequencing, bipartite network analysis, and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states. Our results demonstrate that while all C. difficile-directed antibiotics were associated with similar reductions in alpha diversity, beta diversity significantly differed on the basis of the particular antibiotic, with differentiating relative abundances of bacterial and fungal assemblages. With the exception of fidaxomicin, each antibiotic was associated with the emergence of potentially pathogenic fungal operational taxonomic units, with predicted bacterial functions enriched for xenobiotic metabolism that could perpetuate the dysbiosis driving CDI. Toxin-independent mechanisms of colitis related to the relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria and fungi were also noted. This study suggests that a transkingdom interaction between fungi and bacteria may be important in CDI pathophysiology, including being a factor in the historically high persistence and recurrence rates associated with this disease. IMPORTANCE Using human fecal samples and including sequencing for both bacterial and fungal taxa, this study compared the conventional antibiotics used to treat C. difficile infection (CDI) from the perspective of the microbiome, which is particularly relevant, given the relationship between dysbiotic states and the development of CDI. Sequencing and imputed functional analyses suggest that C. difficile-directed antibiotics are associated with distinct forms of dysbiosis that may be influential in the course of CDI. Further, a role for fungal organisms in the perpetuation of the causal dysbiosis of CDI is discussed, suggesting a previously unappreciated, clinically relevant transkingdom interaction that warrants further study.","2018-02","2022-06-27 16:29:06","2022-07-19 17:18:31","","","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-antibiotics; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Epidemiological studies have characterized this unique cohort and a decreased risk of developing IBD with emigration. Therefore, this well-characterized Faroese IBD cohort gives the opportunity to better understand this complex disease. This study represents the first investigation of the gut microbiota for the cohort. Methods This cross-sectional study consisted of 41 patients with established ulcerative colitis and 144 age- and sex-matched healthy controls recruited through the Faroe Genome project. Participants donated a 1-time fecal sample and completed questionnaires on food frequency, background health, and lifestyle. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region was performed followed by bioinformatic analysis of taxonomy and diversity metrics. Results The overall bacterial composition in both groups was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. No significant differences were found based on metrics of alpha or beta diversity. However, discriminatory analysis identified differential abundance of several indicator taxa in healthy controls and ulcerative colitis participants, whereas Akkermansia was completely absent from 27% of all study participants. Food frequency questionnaires revealed similar dietary patterns between the 2 groups. Conclusion The similarity in bacterial community composition and absence of the beneficial Akkermansia genus in both groups raise further questions concerning the underlying susceptibility toward inflammatory disorders within this high-risk population. Results vary widely by study design and geographic location, which speaks to the need for regionally tuned reference groups and disease-based studies on the Faroe Islands.

The composition and diversity of the subgingival microflora and their oligotypes in health and levels of periodontal disease were investigated in this study on older postmenopausal women. The 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform in 1,206 women aged 53 to 81 y. Presence and severity of periodontal disease were defined by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology criteria. Composition of the microbiome was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and the abundance of taxa described by the centered log(2)-ratio (CLR) transformed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) values. Differences according to periodontal disease status were determined by analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Bacteria oligotypes associated with periodontal disease and health were determined by minimum entropy decomposition and their functions estimated in silico using PICRUSt. Prevalence of none/mild, moderate, and severe periodontal disease was 25.1%, 58.3%, and 16.6%, respectively. Alpha diversity of the microbiome differed significantly across the 3 periodontal disease categories. beta-Diversity differed between no/mild and severe periodontal disease, although considerable overlap was noted. Of the 267 bacterial species identified at >= 0.02% abundance, 56 (20.9%) differed significantly in abundance according to periodontal disease status. Significant linear correlations for pocket depth and clinical attachment level with bacterial amounts were observed for several taxa. Of the taxa differing in abundance according to periodontal disease status, 53% had multiple oligotypes appearing to differ between none/mild and severe periodontal disease. Among older women, taxonomic differences in subgingival microbiome composition and diversity were observed in relation to clinical periodontal disease measures. Potential differences in bacterial subspecies (oligotypes) and their function were also identified in periodontal disease compared with health.","2019-08","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-06-29 17:15:26","","975-984","","9","98","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is likely that the Arctic biome will experience considerable shifts in ice melt season length, leading to changes in photoirradiance and in the freshwater inputs to the marine environment. The exchange of nutrients between Arctic surface and deep waters and their cycling throughout the water column is driven by seasonal change. The impacts, however, of the current global climate transition period on the biodiversity of the Arctic Ocean and its activity are not yet known. To determine seasonal variation in the microbial communities in the deep water column, samples were collected from a profile (1-1000 m depth) in the waters around the Svalbard archipelago throughout an annual cycle encompassing both the polar night and day. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was used to monitor prokaryote diversity. In epipelagic surface waters (<200 m depth), seasonal diversity varied significantly, with light and the corresponding annual phytoplankton bloom pattern being the primary drivers of change during the late spring and summer months. In the permanently dark mesopelagic ocean depths (>200 m), seasonality subsequently had much less effect on community composition. In summer, phytoplankton-associated Gammaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia dominated surface waters, whilst in low light conditions (surface waters in winter months and deeper waters all year round), the Thaumarchaeota and Chlorotlexi-type SAR202 predominated. Alpha-diversity generally increased in epipelagic waters as seasonal light availability decreased; OTU richness also consistently increased down through the water column, with the deepest darkest waters containing the greatest diversity. Beta-diversity analyses confirmed that seasonality and depth also primarily drove community composition. The relative abundance of the eleven predominant taxa showed significant changes in surface waters in summer months and varied with season depending on the phytoplankton bloom stage; corresponding populations in deeper waters however, remained relatively unchanged. Given the significance of the annual phytoplankton bloom pattern on prokaryote diversity in Arctic waters, any changes to bloom dynamics resulting from accelerated global warming will likely have major impacts on surface marine microbial communities, those impacts inevitably trickling down into deeper waters.","2017","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-06-30 20:48:24","","","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-depth; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, soil bacteria along an elevation gradient in an alpine meadow ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were investigated using Illumina sequencing and GeoChip technologies. The community structure of the soil bacteria and plants presented a continuous trend along the elevation gradient, and their alpha diversity displayed different distribution patterns; however, there were no linkages between them. Beta diversity of the soil bacteria and plants was significantly influenced by elevational distance changes (p < 0.05). Functional gene categories involved in nitrogen and phosphorus cycling had faster changes than those involved in carbon degradation, and functional genes involved in labile carbon degradation also had faster variations than those involved in recalcitrant carbon degradation with elevational changes. According to Pearson's correlation, partial Mantel test analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis, soil pH and mean annual precipitation were important environmental variables in influencing soil bacterial diversity.

The results of these studies suggest that bacteria capable of producing volatile metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and butyrate, play opposing, yet important roles in the cascade of events leading to stroke. However, no large-scale studies have been undertaken to determine the abundance of these bacterial communities in stroke patients and to assess the impact of disrupted compositions of the intestinal microbiota on patient outcomes. In this prospective case-control study, rectal swabs from 349 ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients (median age, 71 years; IQR: 67-75) were collected within 24 h of hospital admission. Samples were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and subsequently compared with samples obtained from 51 outpatient age- and sex-matched controls (median age, 72 years; IQR, 62-80) with similar cardiovascular risk profiles but without active signs of stroke. Plasma protein biomarkers were analyzed using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed higher disruption of intestinal communities during ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke compared with non-stroke matched control subjects. Additionally, we observed an enrichment of bacteria implicated in TMAO production and a loss of butyrate-producing bacteria. Stroke patients displayed two-fold lower plasma levels of TMAO than controls (median 1.97 vs 4.03 mu M, Wilcoxonp < 0.0001). Finally, lower abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria within 24 h of hospital admission was an independent predictor of enhanced risk of post-stroke infection (odds ratio 0.77,p = 0.005), but not of mortality or functional patient outcome. In conclusion, aberrations in trimethylamine- and butyrate-producing gut bacteria are associated with stroke and stroke-associated infections.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 18:04:15","","581-592","","4","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Broiler chickens are particularly susceptible to HS due to their high metabolic rate and rapid growth. The commensal intestinal bacterial populations have an important physiological role in the host and could ameliorate the negative effect of HS on the host. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare changes in the ileal (IL) microbiota in four different broiler lines during HS. Results Day-old broiler chicks from Giant Jungle Fowl (JF), Athens Canadian Random Bred (ACRB), 1995 Random Bred (L1995), and Modern Random Bred (L2015) lines were raised under thermoneutral (TN) conditions until day (d) 28. On d 29 birds were subjected to TN (24 degrees C) or chronic cyclic HS (8 h/d, 36 degrees C) condition till d 56. On d 56 two birds per pen were euthanized, and IL luminal content (IL-L) and mucosal scrapings (IL-M) were collected for bacterial DNA isolation. Libraries were constructed using V3-V4 16S rRNA primers and sequenced using MiSeq. DNA sequences were analyzed using QIIME2 platform and SILVA 132 database for alpha and beta diversity, and taxonomic composition, respectively. Functional property of microbiota was predicted using the PICRUSt 2 pipeline and illustrated with STAMP software. Shannon index was significantly elevated in IL-M under HS. beta-diversity PCoA plots revealed separation of microbial community of L2015-TN from JF-TN, JF-HS, ACRB-TN, and ACRB-HS in the IL-M. PERMANOVA analysis showed a significant difference between microbial community of L1995-HS compared to ACRB-HS and JF-TN, L1995-TN compared to ACRB-HS and JF-TN, L2015-HS compared to ACRB-HS and ACRB-TN, L2015-HS compared to JF-TN, L2015-TN compared to ACRB-HS and JF-TN, and ACRB-HS compared to JF-TN in the IL-L. The impact of HS on microbial composition of IL-M was more prominent compared to IL-L with 12 and 2 taxa showing significantly different relative abundance, respectively. Furthermore, differences in microbiota due to the genetic line were more prominent in IL-M than IL-L with 18 and 8 taxa showing significantly different relative abundance, respectively. Unlike taxonomy, predicted function of microbiota was not affected by HS. Comparison of L2015 with JF or ACRB showed significant changes in predicted function of microbiota in both, IL-M and IL-L. Differences were most prominent between L2015 and JF; while there was no difference between L2015 and L1995. Conclusions These data indicate the genetic line x temperature effect on the diversity and composition of IL microbiota. Moreover, the data showcase the effect of host genetics on the composition of IL microbiota and their predicted function. These data are of critical importance for devising nutritional strategies to maintain GIT microbial balance and alleviate the negative effects of HS on broiler chickens' performance and health.","2022-04-21","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 15:25:13","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-chicken gut; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study investigated alterations and host cytokine responses in patients with HD. We enrolled 33 HD patients and 33 sex- and age- matched healthy controls. Fecal microbiota communities were determined through 16S ribosomal DNA gene sequencing, from which we analyzed fecal microbial richness, evenness, structure, and differential abundance of individual taxa between HD patients and healthy controls. HD patients were evaluated for their clinical characteristics, and the relationships of fecal microbiota with these clinical characteristics were analyzed. Plasma concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assays, and relationships between microbiota and cytokine levels were analyzed in the HD group. HD patients showed increased alpha-diversity (richness), beta-diversity (structure), and altered relative abundances of several taxa compared to those in healthy controls. HD-associated clinical characteristics correlated with the abundances of components of fecal microbiota at the genus level. Genus Intestinimonas was correlated with total functional capacity scores and IL-4 levels. Our present study also revealed that genus Bilophila were negatively correlated with proinflammatory IL-6 levels.

The functional analysis revealed that genes related to tryptophan and purine biosynthesis were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to citrate cycle, vitamin B-6, and glycan metabolism were less abundant. The evaluation of serum metabolites revealed altered levels of L-glutamic acid, taurine, and D-tyrosine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The most modified metabolites strongly inversely correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the Clostridiales, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on neurometabolic activity. This study is the first to reveal gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia and identified potential links between gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of isolated dystonia. IMPORTANCE Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, the cause for the majority of cases is not known. This is the first study so far that reveals significant alterations of gut microbiome and correlates the alteration of serum metabolites with gut dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia. We demonstrated a general overrepresentation of Clostridiales and underrepresentation of Bacteroidetes in patients with dystonia in comparison with healthy controls. The functional analysis found that genes related to the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin, were more active in isolated dystonia patients. Altered levels of several serum metabolites were found to be associated with microbial changes, such as D-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in neurotransmitter metabolism in isolated dystonia. Integrative analysis suggests that neurotransmitter system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. The gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the pathogenesis of dystonia, suggesting new potential therapeutic directions.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 14:45:15","","","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To evaluate the clinical relationship between the vaginal microbiome and the pathophysiology of recurrent vaginitis (RV), we investigated the microbiome taxonomic profile (MTP) in the vaginal samples of Korean female patients with RV. MethodsForty women of reproductive age diagnosed with RV were enrolled. The vaginal MTP of patients was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, and the results were compared with that of healthy women (n = 100). Further, the association of the vaginal community state type (CST) with the clinical characteristics was analyzed. ResultsThe species abundance of MTP was significantly lower in patients with RV than in healthy women (p < 0.05), whereas species evenness and diversity were significantly higher in patients with RV than in healthy individuals (p < 0.05). The proportion of the most common vaginal Lactobacillus spp. was significantly lower in the MTP of patients with RV than healthy women (p < 0.01). The beta diversity distance was also significantly different between patients with RV patients and healthy individuals (p = 0.001). Based on the CST, the MTP of 40 RV samples was categorized as follows: 21 (52.5%) for CST IV, 8 (20.0%) for CST III, 5 (12.5%) for CST I, 2 (5.0%) for CST II, 1 for (2.5%) for CST V, and 3 (7.5%) for mixed CST. Patients with underlying uterine diseases (uterine leiomyoma, adenomyosis, and endometrial polyps; n = 17) showed higher species richness and diversity than those without (n = 23; p < 0.05). ConclusionChanges in the species abundance and microbial diversity in the vagina were strongly associated with RV. A low proportion of Lactobacillus spp. was found in patients with RV than in healthy women. The abundance and diversity of bacterial taxa were significantly higher in patients with underlying gynecologic disease than those without. Our study offers an insight into the nature of the vaginal microbiome and proposes that surveying the vaginal microbiome is valuable for detecting and treating gynecologic diseases in the future.","2022-02-18","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 17:48:48","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human vagina; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of oropharyngeal administration of colostrum on the establishment of preterm infants' oral microbiota. A longitudinal observational study was carried out with 20 premature neonates, divided into two groups: one receiving the protocol (Oropharyngeal Administration of Colostrum; OAC) and the other one receiving Standard Caare (SC). Saliva samples were collected from the newborns weekly during the study period (from the day of birth until the 21st day of life) for analysis of oral microbiota through 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

However, there are few studies evaluating how field methods influence fecal microbiome characterization and metabolomics profiling. Methods: Five fecal collection methods [immediate freezing at -20 degrees C without preservative, OMNIgene GUT, 95% ethanol, RNAlater, and Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards] were used to collect 40 fecal samples from eight healthy volunteers. We performed gut microbiota 16S rRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics profiling, and targeted metabolomics focusing on short chained fatty acids (SCFAs). Metrics included alpha-diversity and beta-diversity as well as distributions of predominant phyla. To evaluate the concordance with the “gold standard” immediate freezing, the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for alternate fecal collection systems were calculated. Correlations between SCFAs and gut microbiota were also examined. Results: The FTA cards had the highest ICCs compared to the immediate freezing method for a alpha-diversity indices (ICCs = 0.96, 0.96, 0.76 for Shannon index, Simpson's Index, Chao-1 Index, respectively), followed by OMNIgene GUT, RNAlater, and 95% ethanol. High ICCs (all >0.88) were observed for all methods for the beta-diversity metric. For untargeted metabolomics, in comparison to immediate freezing which detected 621 metabolites at >= 75% detectability level, 95% ethanol showed the largest overlapping set of metabolites (n = 430; 69.2%), followed by FTA cards (n = 330; 53.1%) and OMNIgene GUT (n = 213; 34.3%). Both OMNIgene GUT (ICCs = 0.82, 0.93, 0.64) and FTA cards (ICCs = 0.87, 0.85, 0.54) had acceptable ICCs for the top three predominant SCFAs (butyric acid, propionic acid and acetic acid). Nominally significant correlations between bacterial genera and SCFAs (P < 0.05) were observed in fecal samples collected by different methods. Of note, a high correlation between the genus Blautia (known butyrate producer) and butyric acid was observed for both immediate freezing (r = 0.83) and FTA cards (r = 0.74). Conclusions: Four alternative fecal collection methods are generally comparable with immediate freezing, but there are differences in certain measures of the gut microbiome and fecal metabolome across methods. Choice of method depends on the research interests, simplicity of fecal collection procedures and ease of transportation to the lab, especially for large epidemiological studies.","2018-08-28","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-18 22:01:30","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-sampling methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pathogenesis of dementia has not been fully elucidated yet. Inflammatory processes are hypothesized to play an important role as a driver for cognitive decline but the origin of inflammation is not clear. We hypothesize that disturbances in gut microbiome composition, gut barrier dysfunction, bacterial translocation and resulting inflammation are associated with cognitive dysfunction in dementia. Methods To test this hypothesis, a cohort of 23 patients with dementia and 18 age and sex matched controls without cognitive impairments were studied. Gut microbiome composition, gut barrier dysfunction, bacterial translocation and inflammation were assessed from stool and serum samples. Malnutrition was assessed by Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF), detailed information on drug use was collected. Microbiome composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, QIIME 2 and Calypso 7.14 tools.

Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, the conjunctival OSM of adults (>18 years old) presenting to an ophthalmic emergency department with acute unilateral keratitis and controls without an acute infectious process was sampled. Samples underwent DNA amplification and 16S sequencing using Illumina MiSeq 250 and were analyzed using Qiime. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sided Student t-test, diversity indices, and principal coordinate analysis. The main outcome measures included relative abundance and alpha and beta diversity. Results: Bacterial DNA was recovered from all 34 eyes of 17 individuals with keratitis (mean age, 49.3 +/- 17.5 years) and 16 eyes of controls (mean age, 56.6 +/- 17.0 years). In the two culture-positive eyes, 16S aligned with culture results. Significant differences in alpha diversities were noted when comparing both eyes of individuals with keratitis to control eyes (all P < 0.05), but no significant differences between the eyes of an individual with keratitis. Principal coordinate analysis plots confirmed this finding, demonstrating separation between either eye of patients with keratitis and controls (both P < 0.01), however not between eyes in patients with unilateral keratitis. Both eyes of individuals with keratitis had greater abundance of Pseudomonas compared with controls both on compositional analysis and linear discriminant analysis. Conclusions: Alterations in the OSM profile are detected in both eyes of individuals with unilateral keratitis compared with controls. Beyond the causative organism, a greater abundance of potential pathogens and lesser abundance of commensal organisms were found. Translational Relevance: The OSM profile is altered in both eyes of individuals with unilateral keratitis, which may lend insight into the role of the microbiome in the pathophysiology of disease.","2021-02","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 17:26:33","","","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human ocular; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bones and Raw Food diets contain a high amount of animal components like meat, offal, and raw meaty bones, combined with comparatively small amounts of plant ingredients like vegetables and fruits as well as different sorts of oil and supplements. While many studies have focused on transmission of pathogens via contaminated meat and on nutritional imbalances, only few studies have evaluated the effect of BARF diets on the fecal microbiome and metabolome. The aim of the study was to investigate differences in the fecal microbiome and the metabolome between dogs on a BARF diet and dogs on a commercial diet (canned and dry dog food). Methods Naturally passed fecal samples were obtained from 27 BARF and 19 commercially fed dogs. Differences in crude protein, fat, fiber, and NFE (Nitrogen-Free Extract) between diets were calculated with a scientific nutrient database. The fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR assays. The fecal metabolome was analyzed in 10 BARF and 9 commercially fed dogs via untargeted metabolomics approach. Results Dogs in the BARF group were fed a significantly higher amount of protein and fat and significantly lower amount of NFE and fiber. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity measures between diet groups. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed a significant difference in beta-diversity (p < 0.01) between both groups. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LefSe) showed a higher abundance of Lactobacillales, Enterobacteriaceae, Fusobacterium and, Clostridium in the BARF group while conventionally fed dogs had a higher abundance of Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. The qPCR assays revealed significantly higher abundance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Clostridium (C.). perfringens and an increased Dysbiosis Index in the BARF group. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of metabolomics data showed clustering between diet groups. Random forest analysis showed differences in the abundance of various components, including increased 4-hydroxybutryric acid (GBH) and 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the BARF group. Based on univariate statistics, several metabolites were significantly different between diet groups, but lost significance after adjusting for multiple comparison. No differences were found in fecal bile acid concentrations, but the BARF group had a higher fecal concentration of cholesterol in their feces compared to conventionally fed dogs. Conclusion Microbial communities and metabolome vary significantly between BARF and commercially fed dogs.","2018-08-15","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-06-30 17:04:12","","","","8","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite standardized housing, diet and husbandry, a recently described gastrointestinal syndrome characterized by duodenal ulcers and strictures was observed in a subset of marmosets sourced from the New England Primate Research Center. As changes in the gut microbiome have been associated with GI diseases, the gut microbiome of 52 healthy, non-stricture marmosets (153 samples) were compared to the gut microbiome of 21 captive marmosets diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer/stricture (57 samples). No significant changes were observed using alpha diversity metrics, and while the community structure was significantly different when comparing beta diversity between healthy and stricture cases, the results were inconclusive due to differences observed in the dispersion of both datasets. Differences in the abundance of individual taxa using ANCOM, as stricture-associated dysbiosis was characterized by Anaerobiospirillum loss and Clostridium perfringens increases. To identify microbial and serum biomarkers that could help classify stricture cases, we developed models using machine learning algorithms (random forest, classification and regression trees, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors) to classify microbiome, serum chemistry or complete blood count (CBC) data. Random forest (RF) models were the most accurate models and correctly classified strictures using either 9 ASVs (amplicon sequence variants), 4 serum chemistry tests or 6 CBC tests. Based on the RF model and ANCOM results, C. perfringens was identified as a potential causative agent associated with the development of strictures. Clostridium perfringens was also isolated by microbiological culture in 4 of 9 duodenum samples from marmosets with histologically confirmed strictures. Due to the enrichment of C. perfringens in situ, we analyzed frozen duodenal tissues using both 16S microbiome profiling and RNAseq. Microbiome analysis of the duodenal tissues of 29 marmosets from the MIT colony confirmed an increased abundance of Clostridium in stricture cases. Comparison of the duodenal gene expression from stricture and non-stricture marmosets found enrichment of genes associated with intestinal absorption, and lipid metabolism, localization, and transport in stricture cases. Using machine learning, we identified increased abundance of C. perfringens, as a potential causative agent of GI disease and intestinal strictures in marmosets.","2022-03-28","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-06-30 16:57:11","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Of the remaining women, 155 presented PD and delivered healthy infants; 18 of these subjects with similar periodontal condition and age matched to the PD-PLBW group, and they became the PD-HD group. From the total group, 11 women exhibited healthy gingiva and had a healthy delivery (HD) and healthy infants (H-HD group), and 3 exhibited healthy gingiva and delivered PLBW infants (H-PLBW group). Periodontal parameters were recorded, and subgingival plaque and serum were collected during 26-28 gestational weeks. For the plaque samples, microbial abundance and diversity were accessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results Women with PD showed an enrichment in the genus Porphyromonas, Treponema, and Filifactor, whereas women with healthy gingiva showed an enrichment in Streptococcus, Actinomyces, and Corynebacterium, independently of the birth status. Although no significant difference was found in the beta diversity between the 4 groups, women that had PLBW infants presented a significantly lower abundance of the genus Neisseria, independently of PD status. Conclusion Lower levels of Neisseria align with preterm low birth weight in pregnant women, whereas a higher abundance of Treponema, Porphyromonas, Fretibacterium, and Filifactor and a lower abundance of Streptococcus may contribute to periodontal disease during pregnancy.","2022-03","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 19:14:13","","2465-2478","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, we reported that obesity can change gut microbiota using the Zucker rat model. Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent approved by the FDA to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adults and children older than 10 years of age. The correlation of short-term metformin treatment and specific alterations to the gut microbiota in obese models is less known. Short-term metformin has been shown to reduce liver steatosis. Here we investigate the effects of short-term metformin treatment on population of gut microbiota profile in an obese rat model. Five week old obese (n = 12) female Zucker rats after 1 week of acclimation, received AIN-93 G diet for 8 weeks and then rats were randomly assigned into two groups (6 rats/group): (1) obese without metformin (ObC), or (2) obese with metformin (ObMet). Metformin was mixed with AIN-93G diet at 1,000 mg/kg of diet. Rats were weighed twice per week. All rats were sacrificed at the end of metformin treatment at 10 weeks and fecal samples were collected and kept at -80 degrees C. Total microbial DNA was collected directly from the fecal samples used for shotgun-metagenomics sequencing and subsequently analyzed using MetaPlAn and HUMAnN. After stringent data filtering and quality control we found significant differences (p = 0.0007) in beta diversity (Aitchison distances) between the ObC vs. ObMet groups. Supervised and unsupervised analysis of the log-ratios Bacteroides dorei and B. massiliensis vs. all other Bacteroides spp., revealed that B. dorei and B. massiliensis were enriched in the ObMet group, while the remaining Bacteroides spp. where enriched in the ObC group (p = 0.002). The contributional diversity of pathways is also significantly associated by treatment group (p = 0.008). In summary, in the obese Zucker rat model, short-term metformin treatment changes the gut microbiota profile, particularly altering the composition Bacteroides spp. between ObC and ObMet.","2022-03-30","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-06-30 18:08:05","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-rodent gut; shotgun sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The deterioration of surface water quality with wastewater is well-known, but less is known about the bacterial community dynamics in the affected surface waters. Understanding the bacterial community characteristics -from the source of contamination, through the watershed to the DW production process-may help safeguard human health and the environment. Results The spatial and seasonal dynamics of bacterial communities, their predicted functions, and potential health-related bacterial (PHRB) reads within the Kokemaenjoki River watershed in southwest Finland were analyzed with the 16S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing method. Water samples were collected from various sampling points of the watershed, from its major pollution sources (sewage influent and effluent, industrial effluent, mine runoff) and different stages of the DW treatment process (pre-treatment, groundwater observation well, DW production well) by using the river water as raw water with an artificial groundwater recharge (AGR). The beta-diversity analysis revealed that bacterial communities were highly varied among sample groups (R = 0.92, p < 0.001, ANOSIM). The species richness and evenness indices were highest in surface water (Chao1; 920 +/- 10) among sample groups and gradually decreased during the DW treatment process (DW production well; Chao1: 320 +/- 20). Although the phylum Proteobacteria was omnipresent, its relative abundance was higher in sewage and industrial effluents (66-80%) than in surface water (55%). Phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were only detected in sewage samples. Actinobacteria was more abundant in the surface water (>= 13%) than in other groups (<= 3%). Acidobacteria was more abundant in the DW treatment process (>= 13%) than in others (<= 2%). In total, the share of PHRB reads was higher in sewage and surface water than in the DW treatment samples. The seasonal effect in bacterial communities was observed only on surface water samples, with the lowest diversity during summer. Conclusions The low bacterial diversity and absence of PHRB read in the DW samples indicate AGR can produce biologically stable and microbiologically safe drinking water. Furthermore, the significantly different bacterial communities at the pollution sources compared to surface water and DW samples highlight the importance of effective wastewater treatment for protecting the environment and human health.","2021-05-22","2022-06-27 16:29:07","2022-07-19 19:46:29","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-seasons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Piglet body weight was recorded on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 17, 24 and 28 and average daily gain (ADG) calculated for the total period. At weaning, piglets were euthanized to collect cecum content for microbial profiling by sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. ADG was higher in both Low and High yeast groups than in Control group (P<0.05). Alpha diversity analyses indicated a more diverse microbiota in the Control group compared with Low yeast group; the High yeast being intermediate (P < 0.01). Similarly, Beta diversity analyses indicated differences among treatments (P = 0.03), mainly between Low yeast and Control groups (P = 0.02). The sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) indicated that Control group was discriminated by a higher abundance of Veillonella, Dorea, Oscillospira and Clostridium; Low yeast treated pigs by higher Blautia, Collinsella and Eubacterium; and High yeast treated pigs by higher Eubacterium, Anaerostipes, Parabacteroides, Mogibacterium and Phascolarctobacterium. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis showed that piglet ADG was positively correlated with genus Prevotella in High yeast group. Yeast supplementation significantly affected microbial diversity in cecal contents of suckling piglets associated with an improvement of short chain fatty acid producing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, yeast treatment improved piglet performance and shaped the piglet cecum microbiota composition in a dose dependent way.","2019-07-22","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-06-30 17:01:04","","","","7","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a known bi-directional interaction between the gut microbiome and brain activity. Several authors have reported associations between changes in gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression or autism. Furthermore, a pediatric-onset neuropsychiatric OCD-related syndrome occurs after streptococcal infection, which might indicate that exposure to certain microbes could be involved in OCD susceptibility. However, only one study has investigated the microbiome of OCD patients to date. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based metagenomic sequencing to analyze the stool and oropharyngeal microbiome composition of 32 OCD cases and 32 age and gender matched controls. We estimated different alpha- and beta-diversity measures and performed LEfSe and Wilcoxon tests to assess differences in bacterial distribution. OCD stool samples showed a trend towards lower bacterial alpha-diversity, as well as an increase of the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae, particularly of the genus Alistipes, and lower relative abundance of Prevotellaceae, and two genera within the Lachnospiraceae: Agathobacer and Coprococcus. However, we did not observe a different Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio between OCD cases and controls. Analysis of the oropharyngeal microbiome composition showed a lower Fusobacteria to Actinobacteria ratio in OCD cases. In conclusion, we observed an imbalance in the gut and oropharyngeal microbiomes of OCD cases, including, in stool, an increase of bacteria from the Rikenellaceae family, associated with gut inflammation, and a decrease of bacteria from the Coprococcus genus, associated with DOPAC synthesis.","2022-01-27","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-06-30 16:59:37","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study analysed the differences in eyelid and buccal microbiomes in patients with UG using next-generation sequencing. Methods: The eyelid and buccal specimens of 34 UG and 25 control patients were collected. The taxonomic composition of the microbiome was obtained via 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Diversity and differential gene expression analyses (DEG) determined taxon differences between the microbiomes of UG and control groups. Results: In both the eyelid and buccal microbiomes, alpha-diversity was lower in UG patients than controls, while beta-diversity in patients with UG was higher than in controls. DEG analysis of the eyelid microbiome revealed various taxa differences, including enrichment of Paenibacillus and Dermacoccus (p-value, 1.31e(-6) and 1.55e(-7), respectively) and depletion of Morganella and Lactococcus (p-value, 6.26e(-12) and 2.55e(-6), respectively) in patients with UG.

Due to the presence of extreme conditions such as lowtemperature and oligotrophy, the lakes of the Tibetan Plateau share environmental features in common with lakes in the polar regions. However, the extent to which these environments are analogous, or indeed whether they harbor similar microbial communities or a high level of endemic species is poorly understood. Here we compared high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from the lakes of the three different regions in order to characterize their taxonomic diversity, the community composition and biogeography. Our results showed despite the similarity in environmental conditions, the spatial distribution of the bacterial communities was distinct with only 3.1% of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) being present in all three regions (although these OTUs did account for a considerable proportion of the total sequences, 36.4%). Sequences belonging to Burkholderiales and Actinomycetales dominated the shared OTUs across all three regions. Scale dependent distance decay patterns provided evidence of dispersal limitation. Climatic variables and dispersal limitation were apparently both important in controlling the spatial distribution of bacterial communities across regions. This work expands our understanding of the diversity and biogeography of lake bacterial communities across the Tibetan Plateau and provides insights into howt hey compare to those of the Antarctic and Arctic.

Methods: Forty individuals provided six oral samples using the OMNIgene ORAL kit and Scope mouthwash oral rinses approximately every two months over 10 months. DNA was extracted using the QIAsymphony and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the MiSeq. To estimate temporal variation, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for a variety of metrics and examined stability after clustering samples into distinct community types using Dirichlet multinomial models (DMMs). Results: The ICCs for the alpha diversity measures were high, including for number of observed bacterial species [0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65-0.82 and 0.79; 95% CI: 0.75-0.94] from OMNIgeneORAL and Scope mouthwash, respectively.

Three clusters provided the best model fit for the DMM from the OMNIgene ORAL samples, and the probability of remaining in a specific cluster was high (59.5%-80.7%). Conclusions: The oral microbiota appears to be stable over time for multiple metrics, but some measures, particularly relative abundance, were less stable.

Bacteriophage therapy can be developed to target emerging diarrhoeal pathogens, but doing so in the absence of microbiome disruption, which occurs with antibiotic treatment, has not been established. Aim. Identify a therapeutic bacteriophage that kills diarrhoeagenic enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) while leaving the human microbiome intact. Methodology. Phages from wastewater in Portland, OR, USA were screened for bacteriolytic activity by overlay assay. One isolated phage, PDX, was classified by electron microscopy and genome sequencing. A mouse model of infection determined whether the phage was therapeutic against EAEC. 16S metagenomic analysis of anaerobic cultures determined whether a normal human microbiome was altered by treatment. Results. Escherichia virus PDX, a member of the strictly lytic family Myoviridae, killed a case-associated EAEC isolate from a child in rural Tennessee in a dose-dependent manner, and killed EAEC isolates from Columbian children. A single dose of PDX (multiplicity of infection: 100) 1 day post-infection reduced EAEC recovered from mouse faeces. PDX also killed EAEC when cultured anaerobically in the presence of human faecal bacteria. While the addition of EAEC reduced the beta-diversity of the human microbiota, that of the cultures with either faeces alone, faeces with EAEC and PDX, or with just PDX phage was not different statistically. Conclusion. PDX killed EAEC isolate EN1E-0007 in vivo and in vitro, while not altering the diversity of normal human microbiota in anaerobic culture, and thus could be part of an effective therapy for children in developing countries and those suffering from EAEC-mediated traveller's diarrhoea without causing dysbiosis.","2020","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-06-30 18:48:17","","309-323","","2","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, production of poultry without soybean in their diets has increased in recent years. In addition, consumers are increasingly supporting alternative (e.g., organic, pasture-raised) chicken production systems for ethical reasons, yet the impacts of a variety of diets on these birds remain unclear. The present study was designed to examine the impact of feeding two different diets-a soybean-based and a soy-free diet-on the intestinal microbiome of pasture-raised chickens. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on the feces, cecal contents, and whole carcass rinses from 5 pasture-raised flocks (3 soybean-based, 2 soy-free) grown over 2 years on the same farm, and their microbiomes were compared. Regardless of diet, the phylum Firmicutes corresponded to 63% or more of the total bacterial abundance in the fecal and cecal samples; however, in the whole carcass rinses, the relative abundance of Firmicutes dropped to similar to 30%. Alpha diversity metrics revealed significant differences without any clear patterns when comparing the 2 diets, but principal coordinate analysis of beta-diversity showed significant differences (P = 0.04) between them. Notably, broilers receiving the soy-free diet had lower abundance of Campylobacter during their entire lifecycle. This effect was particularly important in the fecal material collected when birds were 12-weeks-old (i.e., day of processing; P = 0.003) and in the whole carcass rinses obtained from the final product (P = 0.04). Abundance of Acinetobacter was also lower (P = 0.05) in the whole carcass rinses from birds consuming the soy-free diet. These data suggest that the presence of soybeans in chicken diets can be an important factor shaping overall microbiomes throughout the farm-to-fork continuum, specifically resulting in a greater presence of the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter and Acinetobacter. Therefore, the use of a soy-free diet can potentially represent a viable strategy to reduce contamination of carcasses in pasture-raised chicken production systems.","2019-05-24","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-19 18:02:00","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, data regarding the influence of fecal collection methods on both metagenomics and metabolomics are sparse. Six fecal collection methods (the gold standard [GS] [i.e., immediate freezing at -80 degrees C with no solution], 95% ethanol, RNAlater, OMNIgene Gut, fecal occult blood test [FOBT] cards, and Microlution) were used to collect 88 fecal samples from eight healthy volunteers for whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS) and untargeted metabolomic profiling. Metrics assessed included the abundances of predominant phyla and alpha- and beta-diversity at the species, gene, and pathway levels. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for microbes and metabolites to estimate (i) stability (day 4 versus day 0 within each method), (ii) concordance (day 0 for each method versus the GS), and (iii) reliability (day 4 for each method versus the GS). For the top 4 phyla and microbial diversity metrics at the species, gene, and pathway levels, generally high stability and reliability were observed for most methods except for 95% ethanol; similar concordances were seen for different methods. For metabolomics data, 95% ethanol showed the highest stability, concordance, and reliability (median ICCs = 0.71, 0.71, and 0.65, respectively). Taken together, OMNIgene Gut, FOBT cards, RNAlater, and Microlution, but not 95% ethanol, were reliable collection methods for gut metagenomic studies. However, 95% ethanol was the best for preserving fecal metabolite profiles. We recommend using separate collecting methods for gut metagenomic sequencing and fecal metabolomic profiling in large population studies. IMPORTANCE The choice of fecal collection method is essential for studying gut microbe-human interactions in large-scale population-based research. In this study, we examined the effects of fecal collection methods and storage time at ambient temperature on variations in the gut microbiome community composition; microbial diversity metrics at the species, gene, and pathway levels; antibiotic resistance genes; and metabolome profiling. Our findings suggest using different fecal sample collection methods for different data generation purposes.

We compared bacterial community compositions (BCCs) and their assembly processes in the root-associated compartments (i.e., rhizosphere and endosphere) of reed and bulk sediment between summer and winter. The BCCs were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene; meanwhile, nullmodel analysis was employed to characterize their assembly mechanisms. The sources of the endosphere BCCs were quantitatively examined using SourceTracker from bulk sediment, rhizosphere, and seed. We observed the highest alpha-diversity and the lowest beta-diversity of BCCs in the rhizosphere in both seasons. We also found a significant increase in alpha - and beta-diversity in summer compared to that in winter among the three compartments. It was demonstrated that rhizosphere sediments were the main source (similar to 70%) of root endosphere bacteria during both seasons. Null-model tests indicated that stochastic processes primarily affected endosphere BCCs, whereas both deterministic and stochastic processes dictated bacterial assemblages of the rhizosphere, with the relative importance of stochastic versus deterministic processes depending on the season. This study suggests that multiple mechanisms of bacterial selection and community assembly exist both inside and outside P. australis roots in different seasons. IMPORTANCE Understanding the composition and assembly mechanisms of rootassociated microbial communities of plants is crucial for understanding the interactions between plants and soil. Most previous studies of the plant root-associated microbiome focused on model and economic plants, with fewer temporal or seasonal investigations. The assembly mechanisms of root-associated bacterial communities in different seasons remain poorly known, especially for the aquatic macrophytes. In this study, we compared the diversity, composition, and relative importance of two different assembly processes (stochastic and deterministic processes) of bacterial communities associated with bulk sediment and the rhizosphere and endosphere of Phragmites australis in summer and winter. While we found apparent differences in composition, diversity, and assembly processes of bacterial communities among different compartments, season played important roles in determining BCCs and their diversity patterns and assemblages. We also found that endosphere bacteria mainly originated from the rhizosphere. The results add new knowledge regarding the plant-microbe interactions in aquatic ecosystems.","2020-07","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-01 14:46:04","","","","14","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-root; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Salivary microbiomes of 35 Hong Kong Chinese subjects' under routine supportive dental care were analyzed. All subjects had been treated for any dental caries or periodontal disease with all restorative treatment completed at least 1 year ago and had <= 3 residual pockets. They were categorized based on a past diagnosis of chronic periodontitis into “healthy” (H) or “periodontitis” (P) categories. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected, genomic DNA was isolated, and high throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA (V3-V4) gene amplicons was performed. The sequences were assigned taxonomy at the species level by using a BLASTN based algorithm that used a combined reference database of HOMD RefSeqV14.51, HOMD RefSeqExtended V1.1 and GreenGeneGold. Species-level OTUs were subjected to downstream analysis in QIIME and R. For P and H group comparisons, community diversity measures were compared, differentially abundant species were determined using DESeq2, and disease indicator species were determined using multi-level pattern analysis within the R package “indicspecies.” Results: P subjects were significantly older than H subjects (p = 0.003) but not significantly different in their BOP scores (p = 0.82). No significant differences were noted in alpha diversity measures after adjusting for age, gender, and BOP or in the beta diversity estimates. Four species; Treponema sp. oral taxon 237, TM7 sp. Oral Taxon A56, Prevotella sp. oral taxon 314, Prevotella sp. oral taxon 304, and Capnocytophaga leadbetteri were significantly more abundant in P than in the H group.

Thirty-seven female non-sex workers (FNSWs) were randomly selected from the gynecology clinic and health examination center. Vaginal swabs were collected, bacterial DNA extracted and 16S rRNA genes were sequenced. Differences in the vaginal microbiome between both groups were compared using bioinformatics analysis. Results: One DNA sample was excluded due to unqualified concentration, therefore 60 samples were sequenced. FSWs had significantly different vaginal microbiota beta diversity, but undifferentiated alpha diversity when compared with non-sex workers. The average relative abundance of Sneathia, Shigella, Neisseria, Chlamydia, Prevotella, Enterococcus and Ureaplasma among FSWs was higher than FNSWs, and relative abundance of Atopobium in FSWs was lower than FNSWs. The Lactobacillus genus was the major genus in both groups. At the species level, Lactobacllus crispatus, Lactobacllus gasseri and Lactobacllus jensenii, in female sex workers, were lower when compared to FNSWs.

This study used microbiota high-throughput sequencing to compare the fecal microbial profile of healthy horses to that of geriatric microbial transplant recipients experiencing diarrhea and tested whether FMT restores microbiota diversity. Methods To evaluate the effect of environment and donor characteristics on the intestinal microbiota, fecal samples were collected per rectum from 15 healthy young-adult (2-12 years) and 15 geriatric (>= 20 years) horses. Additionally, FMT was performed for 3 consecutive days in 5 geriatric horses with diarrhea using feces from the same healthy donor. Fecal samples were collected from both donor and recipient prior to each FMT and from recipients 24 hours following the last FMT. The profile of the fecal bacterial microbiota was compared using 16S amplicon sequencing. Results and conclusions In contrast to diet and farm location, age did not significantly affect the healthy equine fecal microbiota, indicating that both healthy geriatric and young-adult horses may serve as FMT donors. The fecal microbiota of horses with diarrhea was significantly more variable in terms of beta-diversity than that of healthy horses. An inverse correlation between diarrhea score and relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was identified in surviving FMT recipients. At study completion, the fecal microbiota of horses which responded to FMT had a higher alpha-diversity than prior to treatment and was phylogenetically more similar to that of the donor.","2020-03-10","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-19 18:06:17","","","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, elevated sea surface temperatures have direct effects on coral microbiomes by promoting growth and virulence of opportunists and putative pathogens, thereby altering host immunity and health. However, interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors have yet to be evaluated. Here, we used a factorial experiment to investigate the combined effects of fecal pellet deposition by the widely distributed surgeonfish Ctenochaetus striatus and elevated sea surface temperatures on microbiomes associated with the reef-building coral Porites lobata. Our results showed that regardless of temperature, exposure of P. lobata to C. striatus feces increased alpha diversity, dispersion, and lead to a shift in microbial community composition - all indicative of microbial dysbiosis. Although elevated temperature did not result in significant changes in alpha and beta diversity, we noted an increasing number of differentially abundant taxa in corals exposed to both feces and thermal stress within the first 48h of the experiment. These included opportunistic microbial lineages and taxa closely related to potential coral pathogens (i.e., Vibrio vulnificus, Photobacterium rosenbergii). Some of these taxa were absent in controls but present in surgeonfish feces under both temperature regimes, suggesting mechanisms of microbial transmission and/or enrichment from fish feces to corals. Importantly, the impact to coral microbiomes by fish feces under higher temperatures appeared to inhibit wound healing in corals, as percentages of tissue recovery at the site of feces deposition were lower at 30 degrees C compared to 26 degrees C. Lower percentages of tissue recovery were associated with greater relative abundance of several bacterial lineages, with some of them found in surgeonfish feces (i.e., Rhodobacteraceae, Bdellovibrionaceae, Crocinitomicaceae). Our findings suggest that fish feces interact with elevated sea surface temperatures to favor microbial opportunism and enhance dysbiosis susceptibility in P. lobata. As the frequency and duration of thermal stress related events increase, the ability of coral microbiomes to recover from biotic stressors such as deposition of fish feces may be greatly affected, ultimately compromising coral health and resilience.","2021-03-25","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-18 22:03:50","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-coral; biome-fish gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies on rodents, pigs, and humans report beneficial effects of aleurone in five main areas: the reduction of oxidative stress, immunomodulatory effects, modulation of energy management, digestive health, and the storage of vitamins and minerals. Our study is the first aleurone supplementation study performed in horses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an increase in the dose levels of aleurone on the postprandial glucose-insulin metabolism and the gut microbiome in untrained healthy horses. Seven adult Standardbred horses were supplemented with four different dose levels of aleurone (50, 100, 200, and 400 g/day for 1 week) by using a Latin square model with a 1-week wash out in between doses. On day 7 of each supplementation week, postprandial blood glucose-insulin was measured and fecal samples were collected. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed and QIIME2 software was used for microbiome analysis. Microbial community function was assessed by using the predictive metagenome analysis tool Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) and using the Metacyc database of metabolic pathways. The relative abundancies of a pathway were analyzed by using analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) in R. There was a significant dose-dependent increase in the postprandial time to peak of glucose (p = 0.030), a significant delay in the time to peak of insulin (p = 0.025), and a significant decrease in both the insulin peak level (p = 0.049) and insulin area under the curve (AUC) (p = 0.019) with increasing dose levels of aleurone, with a consideration of 200 g being the lowest significant dose. Alpha diversity and beta diversity of the fecal microbiome showed no significant changes. Aleurone significantly decreased the relative abundance of the genera Roseburia, Shuttleworthia, Anaerostipes, Faecalibacter, and Succinovibrionaceae. The most pronounced changes in the relative abundance at phyla level were seen in Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia (downregulation) and Bacteroidetes and Spirochaetes (upregulation). The PICRUSt analysis shows that aleurone induces a downregulation of the degradation of L-glutamate and taurine and an upregulation of the three consecutive pathways of the phospholipid membrane synthesis of the Archaea domain. The results of this study suggest a multimodal effect of aleurone on glucose-insulin metabolism, which is most likely to be caused by its effect on feed texture and subsequent digestive processing; and a synergistic effect of individual aleurone components on the glucose-insulin metabolism and microbiome composition and function.","2021-04-12","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-18 21:56:24","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; var-prebiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The long-term exposure to antibiotics could cause consequent changes in gut microbiota, which may alter the gastrointestinal function and drug absorption in patients, thereby affect the outcome of treatment. The study aims to characterize the longitudinal changes of gut microbiota among tuberculosis (TB) patients under standardized first-line treatment and provide an understanding of the association between alterations in gut microbiota composition and unfavorable clinical outcomes. Methods The study is a multicenter, observational prospective cohort study. Three study sites are purposively selected in the western (Sichuan Province) and eastern (Jiangsu Province and Shanghai) parts of China. Three-hundred patients with bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB are enrolled. All eligible patients should be investigated using structured questionnaires before treatment initiation; and be followed up during the treatment at Day-14, Month-2, Month-5, the end of treatment and the sixth month after ending therapy. Stool samples are to be collected at each visit, consisting of six stool samples from each patient. Additionally, 60 healthy volunteers from Sichuan province and Shanghai city will be recruited as healthy controls to form the baseline of patient gut microbiota in the Chinese population. The dynamic changes of gut microbiota in terms of alpha diversity, beta diversity, taxonomic composition are to be illustrated individually from the time at diagnosis until the sixth month after therapy is completed. Furthermore, the diversity and component of gut microbiota will be compared between the groups with and without unfavorable treatment outcome in terms of adverse effect and treatment failure. Discussion Studies on the clinical manifestations, adverse reactions, and gut microbiota alterations will provide scientifically-sound evidence on the impact of gut microbiota alterations on TB treatment outcomes. The study is not only useful for guiding personalized TB treatment but also sheds light on the effects of continuous antibiotics administration on gut microbiota.","2019-11-11","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-06-30 20:44:06","","","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been reportedly associated with many of these cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep length on the gut microbiota in a large cohort of 655 participants of African descent, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa (SA), Jamaica, and the United States (US). The sleep duration was self-reported via a questionnaire. Participants were classified into 3 sleep groups: short (<7hrs), normal (7-<9hrs), and long (>= 9hrs). Forty-seven percent of US participants were classified as short sleepers and 88% of SA participants as long sleepers. Gut microbial composition analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with sleep length (p<0.05). Furthermore, sleep length significantly contributed to the inter-individual beta diversity dissimilarity in gut microbial composition (p<0.01). Participants with both short and long-sleep durations exhibited significantly higher abundances of several taxonomic features, compared to normal sleep duration participants. The predicted relative proportion of two genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine pathway were enriched in short sleep duration participants. Finally, co-occurrence relationships revealed by network analysis showed unique interactions among the short, normal and long duration sleepers. These results suggest that sleep length in humans may alter gut microbiota by driving population shifts of the whole microbiota and also specific changes in Exact Sequence Variants abundance, which may have implications for chronic inflammation associated diseases. The current findings suggest a possible relationship between disrupted sleep patterns and the composition of the gut microbiota. Prospective investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep researches and causally experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the underlying mechanism and determine whether improving microbial homeostasis may buffer against sleep-related health decline in humans.","2021-09-08","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-06-30 17:01:58","","","","9","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response to this habitat loss, there are efforts to grow, outplant, and restore corals in many regions. The physical oceanographic habitat of corals-such as sea temperature, waves, ocean currents, and available light-is spatially heterogeneous. We therefore hypothesize that outplant location may affect microbiomes, and ultimately, coral health and restoration success. We evaluated the influence of the physical oceanographic habitat on microbes in wild Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea. Tissue samples were collected at four Florida reefs in March, June, and September of 2015. We estimated oceanographic conditions from moored instruments, diver observations, remote sensing data, and numerical models. We analyzed microbiomes using amplicon 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing data. We found microbial alpha-diversity negatively correlated with in situ sea temperature (which represented both the annual cycle and upwelling), as well as modeled alongshore currents, in situ sea-level, and modeled tide. Microbial beta-diversity correlated positively with significant wave height and alongshore currents from models, remotely-sensed relative turbidity, and in situ temperature. We found that archaea from the order Marine Group II decrease with increases in significant wave height, suggesting that this taxon may be influenced by waves. Also, during times of high wave activity, the relative abundance of bacteria from the order Flavobacteriales increases, which may be due to resuspension and cross-shelf transport of sediments. We also found that bacteria from the order SAR86 increase in relative abundance with increased temperature, which suggests that this taxon may play a role in the coral microbiome during periods of higher temperature. Overall, we find that physical oceanographic variability correlates with the structure of these coral microbiomes in ways that could be significant to coral health.","2019-09-10","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-19 19:51:43","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Effective restoration requires contaminant sources identification. Microbial communities are increasingly used to characterize fecal contamination sources. The objective was to determine whether nearshore and adjacent beach bacterial contamination originated from the Grand Calumet River, a highly urbanized aquatic ecosystem, and to determine if there were correlations between pathogens/feces associated bacteria in any of the samples to counts of the pathogen indicator species Escherichia coli. Water samples were collected from the river, river mouth, nearshore, and offshore sites along southern Lake Michigan. Comparisons among communities were made using beta diversity distances (weighted and unweighted Unifrac, and Bray Curtis) and Principal Coordinate Analysis of 16S rRNA gene Illumine sequence data that indicated river bacterial communities differed significantly from the river mouth, nearshore lake, and offshore lake samples. These differences were further supported using Source Tracker software that indicated nearshore lake communities differed significantly from river and offshore samples. Among locations, there was separation by sampling date that was associated with environmental factors (e.g., water and air temperature, water turbidity). Although about half the genera (48.1%) were common to all sampling sites, linear discriminant analysis effect size indicated there were several taxa that differed significantly among sites; there were significant positive correlations of feces-associated genera with E. coli most probable numbers. Results collectively highlight that understanding microbial communities, rather than relying solely on select fecal indicators with uncertain origin, are more useful for developing strategies to restore degraded aquatic habitats.","2019-05-14","2022-06-27 16:29:08","2022-07-19 17:03:15","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-water","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results showed that Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla, occupying more than 50% of total phyla, across all the specimens. At genus level, “Candidates Hepatoplasma” was overall dominant, followed by Psychromonas in H. gigas and Psychrobacter in Halice sp. MT-2017 respectively. Notably, though two hadal amphipod species shared the same predominant symbiont of genus “Ca.

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of oral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AC) on the LM in healthy dogs (n = 6) at short (immediately after stopping AC [D10]) and medium-term (16 days after stopping AC [D26]). Metagenetic analyses were performed on the V1-V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA after extraction of total bacterial DNA from samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). AC did not induce significant changes in BALF cellular counts or in the bacterial load or microbial richness, evenness and a-diversity, while the beta-diversity was clearly modified at D10 compared with DO (before AC administration) and D26 (P < 0.01). The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria increased at D10 (P < 0.01) in comparison with DO and D26 (P < 0.01).

Several studies have shown that the gut microbiota as a close-up environmental mediator influences host physiology including metabolism. The aim of the present study is to examine the compositional and functional potential of the gut microbiota across individuals from Denmark and South India with a focus on T2D. Many earlier studies have investigated the microbiome aspects of T2D, and it has also been anticipated that such microbial associations would be dependent on diet and ethnic origin. However, there has been no large scale trans-ethnic microbiome study earlier in this direction aimed at evaluating any “universal” microbiome signature of T2D. Methods 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on stool samples from 279 Danish and 294 Indian study participants. Any differences between the gut microbiota of both populations were explored using diversity measures and negative binomial Wald tests. Study samples were stratified to discover global and country-specific microbial signatures for T2D and treatment with the anti-hyperglycemic drug, metformin. To identify taxonomical and functional signatures of the gut microbiota for T2D and metformin treatment, we used alpha and beta diversity measures and differential abundances analysis, comparing metformin-naive T2D patients, metformin-treated T2D patients, and normoglycemic individuals. Results Overall, the gut microbial communities of Danes and Indians are compositionally very different. By analyzing the combined study materials, we identify microbial taxonomic and functional signatures for T2D and metformin treatment. T2D patients have an increased relative abundance of two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the Lachnospiraceae family, and a decreased abundance of Subdoligranulum and Butyricicoccus. Studying each population per se, we identified T2D-related microbial changes at the taxonomic level within the Danish population only. Alpha diversity indices show that there is no significant difference between normoglycemic individuals and metformin-naive T2D patients, whereas microbial richness is significantly decreased in metformin-treated T2D patients compared to metformin-naive T2D patients and normoglycemic individuals. Enrichment of two OTUs from Bacteroides and depletion of Faecalibacterium constitute a trans-ethnic signature of metformin treatment. Conclusions We demonstrate major compositional differences of the gut microbiota between Danish and South Indian individuals, some of which may relate to differences in ethnicity, lifestyle, and demography. By comparing metformin-naive T2D patients and normoglycemic individuals, we identify T2D-related microbiota changes in the Danish and Indian study samples. In the present trans-ethnic study, we confirm that metformin changes the taxonomic profile and functional potential of the gut microbiota.","2021-03-03","2022-06-27 16:29:09","2022-07-18 21:36:51","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although microbial diversity is well-investigated worldwide, most of the studies are spatially too restricted to allow general statements about global diversity patterns. Additionally, methodological differences make it hard and often impossible to compare several studies. This study investigated the cyanobacterial diversity in tidal flats along geographical and ecological gradients based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments (Illumina MiSeq) and environmental data on a large spatial scale from the subtropics to the Arctic. Latitude and strongly correlated environmental parameters (e.g. temperature) were identified as important drivers of cyanobacterial diversity on global scale resulting in a latitudinal diversity gradient similar to that known from plants and animals. Other non-correlated parameters (e.g. grain size) were shown to be more important on local scales, although no consistent pattern occurred across different locations. Among a total number of 989 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) only one cosmopolitan (classified as Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes), but many location-specific and putative endemic ones (78%) were detected.

Methods. Twenty-two pSS patients and 23 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Their clinical data and oral rinse samples were collected. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene of samples were amplified and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina Miseq PE300 platform. Results. Both two groups were age- and sex-matched. There were significantly higher decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) and decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS) in the pSS group than in the control group (p < 0.01). Alpha diversity was depleted in pSS patients, compared with healthy controls (p < 0.01), while beta diversity between the two groups was not significantly different. Seven discriminative genera (LDA > 4) were found between the two groups in LEfSe (LDA Effect Size) analysis. The relative abundance of Veillonella in pSS patients was fourfold higher, while Actinomyces, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, Porphyromonas and Peptostreptococcus were significantly lower in pSS patients than in healthy controls. However, the correlation between Veillonella and DMFT/DMFS was not significant (p > 0.05). In Venn diagram analysis, nine genera shared by all samples of two groups, which comprised 71.88% and 67.64% in pSS patients and controls, respectively. Discussion. These findings indicate a microbial dysbiosis in pSS patients; notably, Veillonella might be recognized as a biomarker in pSS patients. The core microbiome in pSS patients was similar to the systemic healthy population. These provide insight regarding advanced microbial prevention and treatment of severe dental caries in pSS patients.

AZLI improves lung function and quality of life, and reduces exacerbations-improvements attributed to its antipseudomonal activity. Given the extremely high aztreonam concentrations achieved in the lower airways by nebulization, we speculate this may extend its spectrum of activity to other organisms. As such, we sought to determine if AZLI affects the CF lung microbiome and whether community constituents can be used to predict treatment responsiveness. Methods: Patients were included if they had chronic P. aeruginosa infection and repeated sputum samples collected before and after AZLI. Sputum DNA was extracted, and the V3-hypervariable region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplified and sequenced. Results: Twenty-four patients naive to AZLI contributed 162 samples. The cohort had a median age of 37. 1 years, and a median FEV1 of 44% predicted. Fourteen patients were a priori defined as responders for achieving >= 3% FEV1 improvement following initiation. No significant changes in alpha diversity were noted following AZLI. Furthermore, beta diversity demonstrated clustering with respect to patients, but had no association with AZLI use. However, we did observe a decline in the relative abundance of several individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) following AZLI initiation suggesting that specific sub-populations of organisms may be impacted. Patients with higher abundance of Staphylococcus and anaerobic organisms including Prevotella and Fusobacterium were less likely to respond to therapy. Conclusions: Results from our study suggest potential alternate/additional mechanisms by which AZLI functions.

However, whether intestinal microbiota is implicated in the mechanisms linking CIH to arteriosclerosis (AS) pathogenesis remains unclear. The association of CIH with the development of altered gut microbiota (GM) may provide the opportunity to develop preventive strategies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk reduction. Animal models of apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice treated with high-fat diet (HFD) and subjected to CIH conditions was applied to mimic the AS observed in patients with OSA. The physiological status and atherosclerotic lesion formation were confirmed by histological analysis. 16S rDNA sequencing of fecal samples was conducted to determine the changes in gut microbial composition. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that CIH caused aggravated atherosclerotic lesions and facilitated AS in apoE(-/-) mice treated with HFD. The gut bacteria was significantly varied in AS and AS+CIH mice compared with that in the control mice. Significantly perturbed GM profiles were detected in AS mice with and without CIH, with altered microbial alpha- and beta- diversity and shifts in bacterial compositions at phylum and genus levels. While the difference between AS and AS+CIH was observed at different bacteria taxa levels. Aggravation of reduced Sutterella and increased Halomonas, Halomonadaceae and Oceanospirillales was noted in CIH-treated AS mice. The correlation of intestinal bacterial parameters with pathological changes in artery indicated complicated interactions under CIH-induced GM dysbiosis. Furthermore, the gut microbial functions in the potential ability of replication recombination and repair proteins, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, as well as metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were identified to be further suppressed by CIH. Our findings demonstrated a causal effect of CIH on GM alterations in AS mice and suggested that the disordered GM features in AS development were deteriorated by CIH, which may be associated with AS aggravation. Preventative strategies targeting gut microbiome are highly recommended for intervention of OSA-related AS.","2021-07-01","2022-06-27 16:29:09","2022-06-30 18:51:07","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-disorder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is considered waste milk (WM), and a convenient option for farmers is using it as calf food. However, adding to the risk of selecting resistant bacteria, residual antibiotics might interfere with the gut microbiome development and influence gastrointestinal health. We assessed the longitudinal effect of unpasteurized WM containing residual cefalexin on calf intestinal health and fecal microbiota in an 8-week trial. After 3 days of colostrum, six calves received WM and six calves received bulk tank milk (BM) for 2 weeks. For the following 6 weeks, all 12 calves received milk substitute and starter feed. Every week for the first 2 weeks and every 2 weeks for the remaining 6 weeks, we subjected all calves to clinical examination and collected rectal swabs for investigating the fecal microbiota composition. Most WM calves had diarrhea episodes in the first 2 weeks of the trial (5/6 WM and 1/6 BM), and their body weight was significantly lower than that of BM calves. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, WM calves had a lower fecal microbiota alpha diversity than that in BM calves, with the lowest p-value at Wk4 (p < 0.02), 2 weeks after exposure to WM. The fecal microbiota beta diversity of the two calf groups was also significantly different at Wk4 (p < 0.05). Numerous significant differences were present in the fecal microbiota taxonomy of WM and BM calves in terms of relative normalized operational taxonomic unit (OTU) levels, affecting five phyla, seven classes, eight orders, 19 families, and 47 genera. At the end of the trial, when 6 weeks had passed since exposure to WM, the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Saccharibacteria were lower, while Chlamydiae were higher in WM calves. Notably, WM calves showed a decrease in beneficial taxa such as Faecalibacterium, with a concomitant increase in potential pathogens such as Campylobacter, Pseudomonas, and Chlamydophila spp. In conclusion, feeding pre-weaned calves with unpasteurized WM containing antibiotics is related to a higher incidence of neonatal diarrhea and leads to significant changes in the fecal microbiota composition, further discouraging this practice in spite of its short-term economic advantages.","2021-07-08","2022-06-27 16:29:09","2022-06-30 19:45:05","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle gut; var-antibiotics; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota may be linked to pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic disorders. Objective. This study compared the gut microbiome of obese Thai children with that of healthy controls and examined their relationships with host lifestyle, adiposity, and metabolic profiles. Methods. This cross-sectional study enrolled obese children aged 7-15. Body composition was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Stool samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Relative abundance and alpha- and beta-diversity were compared with normal-weight Thai children from a previous publication using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and ANOSIM. Relationships of gut microbiota with lifestyle activity, body composition, and metabolic profiles were assessed by canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Spearman correlation. Results. The study enrolled 164 obese children with a male percentage of 59%. Mean age was 10.4 +/- 2.2 years with a BMI z-score of 3.2 +/- 1. The abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were found to be lower in obese children compared to nonobese children. Alpha-diversity indices showed no differences between groups, while beta-diversity revealed significant differences in the family and genus levels. CCA revealed significant correlations of the relative abundance of gut microbial phyla with sedentary lifestyle and certain metabolic markers. Univariate analysis revealed that Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium were positively correlated with HDL-C and negatively correlated with body weight and screen time. Additionally, Actinobacteria was also negatively associated with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR. Lactobacillus showed positive correlation with acanthosis nigricans and adiposity. Cooccurrence analysis revealed 90 significant bacterial copresence and mutual exclusion interactions among 43 genera in obese children, whereas only 2 significant cooccurrences were found in nonobese children. Conclusions. The composition and diversity of gut microbiota in obese Thai children were different from those of their normal-weight peers. Specific gut microbiota were associated with lifestyle, adiposity, and metabolic features in obese children.

However, it is unknown if the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children with acute otitis media (AOM) can serve as an age-dependent or independent proxy for the microbial communities of the middle ear fluid (MEF) as there is a lack of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing studies simultaneously analyzing the microbial communities of the two sites. Within this study, we performed 16S rRNA next generation sequencing on a total of 286 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) collected between 2004 and 2013 within a Swiss national AOM surveillance program from children (0-6 years) with AOM. In addition, 42/286 children had spontaneous tympanic membrane perforation and, therefore, those MEF could also be analyzed. We found that alpha [Richness, Shannon diversity index (SDI) and Evenness] and beta diversity measurements of the nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiota showed a clear dependency of the increasing age of the children. In more detail, bacterial richness and personalized profiles (measured by beta dispersion) were higher and more frequent in older children, respectively. Dissimilarity values based on the binary distance matrix of the microbiota patterns of the NP and the MEF also correlated with increasing age. In general, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the NP were moderately and well predictive for their presence in the MEF, respectively. This data is crucial to better understand polymicrobial infections and therefore AOM pathogenesis.","2019-06-19","2022-06-27 16:29:09","2022-06-30 18:13:04","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human ear; var-age; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Animals Eight healthy horses stabled on straw and fed 100% haylage. Methods Prospective controlled study. Transendoscopic gastric glandular biopsies, gastric fluid, and fecal samples were obtained from each horse twice at a 7-day interval before the administration of omeprazole. Samples were taken on the same horses before and after a 7-day administration of omeprazole (4 mg/kg PO q24h). pH was assessed on fresh gastric fluid and other samples were kept at -20 degrees C until analysis. Bacterial taxonomy profiling was obtained by V1V3 16S amplicon sequencing from feces and gastric glandular biopsies. Analysis of alpha, beta diversity, and comparison between time points were performed with MOTHUR and results were considered significant whenP < .05. Results Gastric pH increased significantly after 7 days of omeprazole administration (P= .006). Omeprazole did not induce significant major changes in composition of fecal or gastric glandular microbiota, however, after administration, certain microbial genera became more predominant in the gastric glandular mucosa (lower Simpson's evenness,P= .05). Only the genusClostridium sensu strictu_1had a significant shift in the glandular gastric mucosa after omeprazole administration (P= .002). No population shifts were observed in feces.

The interaction among the different structures of gut bacterial community in the fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, and different host plants, and whether these different gut bacteria are responsible for the rapid spread of FAW to a variety of host plants after invasion are largely unexplored. In the present paper, we used a culture-independent approach targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene of gut bacteria of the 5th instar larvae of FAW fed on four different host plants. It aimed to analyze the effects of host plants on gut bacteria abundance, community structure and metabolic function. We found that host plants exerted considerable effects on the structure and composition of the gut bacteria in FAW and the differences among the four groups identified were significant. They were related to the detoxification and adaptation of FAW to toxic secondary metabolites of the host plant. These differences enabled the gut microbiome to perform different functions. This study lays a foundation for further studies on the function of intestinal bacteria in FAW and the adaptive mechanism to the host. The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, is one of the most important invasive species and causes great damage to various host crops in China. In this study, the diversity and function of gut bacteria in the 5th instar larvae of FAW fed on maize, wheat, potato and tobacco leaves were analyzed through 16S rRNA sequencing. A total of 1324.25 +/- 199.73, 1313.5 +/- 74.87, 1873.00 +/- 190.66 and 1435.25 +/- 139.87 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from the gut of FAW fed on these four different host plants were detected, respectively. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant bacterial phyla. Beta diversity analysis showed that the gut bacterial community structure of larvae fed on different host plants was significantly differentiated. At the genus level, the abundance of Enterococcus in larvae fed on wheat was significantly lower than those fed on the other three host plants. Enterobacter and ZOR0006 were dominant in FAW fed on tobacco leaves, and in low abundance in larvae fed on wheat. Interestingly, when fed on Solanaceae (tobacco and potato) leaves which contained relative higher levels of toxic secondary metabolites than Gramineae (wheat and maize), the genera Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Acinetobacter were significantly enriched. The results indicated that gut bacteria were related to the detoxification and adaptation of toxic secondary metabolites of host plants in FAW. Further analysis showed that replication, repair and nucleotide metabolism functions were enriched in the gut bacteria of larvae fed on tobacco and potato. In conclusion, the gut bacterial diversity and community composition in FAW larvae fed on different host plants showed significant differences, and the insect is likely to regulate their gut bacteria for adaptation to different host plants.","2022-04","2022-06-27 16:29:09","2022-07-19 14:38:47","","","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-insect gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the investigation and comparison of the bacterial communities of pond cultivation (PC) and greenhouse cultivation (GC) between hatchling, juvenile, and adult growth stages ofC. reevesiiwere performed. In addition, the V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. The Chao1 richness estimator of the PC group was significantly higher than that of the GC group. The beta diversity showed that the microbiotas of the two groups were isolated from each other. The dominant phyla were Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes in the PC group and Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria in the GC group. Both the numbers and the types of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotations differed between the PC and GC groups. The prediction of bacterial phenotype implied that the GC environment is more likely to deteriorate, and turtles are more susceptible to pathogens than those of the PC environment. In addition, a total of nine potential pathogenic bacteria were identified and the correlation of environmental factors analyses showed significant differences of bacterial species between the PC and GC groups, while the potential pathogenic bacteria showed significant correlation with the stocking density, temperature, pH, orthophosphate (PO4-P), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in both the PC and GC groups.

Dog owners in the U.S. have increasingly shown an interest in feeding their dogs a mildly cooked (MC) diet. However, its impact on canine GM and health remains largely unknown. Methods: Healthy household dogs were tracked upon switching from various brands of extruded to MC diets for four weeks. A health assessment was completed and stool samples were collected by each owner before (day 0) and after the diet transition (day 28). Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed at both time points to characterize the GM. Results: Dogs completed the study by either completing the health assessments (n = 31) or providing stool samples at both time points (n = 28). All owners reported either better or no change in overall health at the end of the study (61% and 39%, respectively), and none reported worse overall health. Defecation frequency was also reported to be lower (58%) or about the same (35%). Principal coordinate (PCo) analysis showed a significant shift (p = 0.004) in the beta-diversity of the GM upon diet transition (34.2% and 10.3% explained by the first two axes). The abundances of 70 species increased after the diet change (adjusted p < 0.05), 67% and 24% of which belonged to the Lactobacillales and the Enterobacterales orders respectively. The abundances of 28 species decreased (adjusted p < 0.05), 46%, 18%, and 11% of which belonged to the Clostridiales, Bacillales, and Bacteroidales orders, respectively. Lower Lactobacillales and Enterobacterales, and higher Bacteroidales at baseline were associated with a greater shift along the PCo1 axis. Protein content of the baseline diet was correlated with the shift along the PCo1 axis (rho = 0.67, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Owners reported either improvement or no change in health in dogs transitioning from extruded kibble to MC diets for 4 weeks, but this report of health perception requires further exploration in a controlled trial. Diet change also led to a significant shift in the GM profile of healthy dogs. The magnitude of shift was associated with baseline GM and dietary protein, and warrants further examination of individualized responses and personalized nutrition in companion dogs. These results also support future investigation of the impact of a MC diet on health maintenance given its increasing popularity.","2021-06-30","2022-06-27 16:29:09","2022-06-30 17:45:19","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-canine gut; shotgun sequencing; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the way in which these microbes influence allergic diseases remain unclear. Forty-seven full-term newborns were selected from a 1000-infant birth cohort. Among them were 23 allergic infants, whereas 24 infants were healthy without allergic symptoms at 1 year of age. Two hundred and sixty-four fecal samples were collected at 7 time points following their birth. These fecal samples were microbiologically analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The dynamic processes involved in gut microbiota diversity and composition in the tested infants were constructed.ResultsHealthy infants demonstrated more statistical differences in longitudinal changes in the alpha diversity of their microbiota at the time points compared with day 0 (meconium) than did allergic infants. Analysis of beta diversity showed that the fecal microbiota of days 0 and 2 comprised different communities in healthy infants, and that there were three separate communities in the fecal microbiota of day 0 of the healthy infants, those of day 2 of the healthy infants, and those of days 0-2 of the allergic infants. The relative abundance of dominant gut microbiota at phylum level varied at different time points in the healthy and diseased groups.

Recently, the influence of gut microbial-derived compounds on host metabolism has become evident, and it has been suggested that some gut bacteria may be involved in testosterone metabolism. In the present study, we examined the relationship between testosterone levels and gut microbiota in elderly Japanese men. Materials and Methods: We collected samples from Japanese male subjects suspected of having prostate cancer and underwent prostate biopsies and excluded patients with positive biopsies to avoid the effect of prostate cancer on the gut microbiota. In total, 54 Japanese males with negative biopsy results were included in our study. The gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of bacterial DNA extracted from rectal swabs. Gut microbiota compositions were compared between the two groups according to the level of serum testosterone (above or below 3.5 ng/mL). Results: The median age of the cohort was 71 years, and the quartile range was 67 to 73 years. We observed no significant difference in alpha or beta diversity, but some bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes (Clostridiales, Turicibacter, and Gemella) were increased in the high testosterone group. Serum testosterone levels positively correlated with the relative amount of Firmicutes (r(s) =0.3323, p=0.0141), and the amount of Firmicutes affected serum testosterone levels independent of host factors (age, body mass index, triglyceride, and total cholesterol; beta=0.770, p=0.0396). Conclusions: Some intestinal bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes were associated with testosterone levels in elderly males. Therefore, the gut microbiota could affect testosterone metabolism in elderly males.","","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-18 22:17:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article; Early Access","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The association between the oral and sputum microbiota and exacerbation phenotype is not well defined. The objective of this study was to determine key features that differentiate the oral and sputum microbiota of FEs from the microbiota of IEs during periods of clinical stability.MethodsWe recruited 11 FE and 11IE who had not used antibiotics or systemic corticosteroids in the last 1month. Subjects provided oral wash and sputum samples, which underwent 16S V4 MiSeq sequencing and qPCR of 16S rRNA. Data were analyzed using Dada2 and R.ResultsFE and IE were similar in terms of age, FEV1 percent predicted (FEV1pp), pack-years of tobacco exposure, and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score. 16S copy numbers were significantly greater in sputum vs. oral wash (p=0.01), but phenotype was not associated with copy number. Shannon diversity was significantly greater in oral samples compared to sputum (p=0.001), and IE samples were more diverse than FE samples (p<0.001). Sputum samples from FE had more Haemophilus and Moraxella compared to IE sputum samples, due to dominance of these COPD-associated taxa in three FE sputum samples. Amplicon sequencing variant (ASV)-level analysis of sputum samples revealed one ASV (Actinomyces) was significantly more abundant in IE vs. FE sputum (p(adj)=0.048, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), and this persisted after controlling for FEV1pp. Principal coordinate analysis using Bray-Curtis distance with PERMANOVA analyses demonstrated clustering by anatomic site, phenotype, inhaled corticosteroid use, current tobacco use, COPD severity, and last professional dental cleaning.ConclusionsFE have less diverse oral and sputum microbiota than IE. Actinomyces was significantly more abundant in IE sputum than FE sputum. The oral and sputum microbiota of COPD subjects cluster based on multiple clinical factors, including exacerbation phenotype. Even during periods of clinical stability, the frequent exacerbator phenotype is associated with decreased alpha diversity, beta-diversity clustering, and changes in taxonomic abundance.","2019-06-07","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-19 18:15:57","","","","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L-Tryptophan (Trp) are metabolized by several genera of bacteria. It remains largely unknown whether Trp can regulate the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota and contribute to intestinal homeostasis. Methods: A total of 126 weaning piglets were fed a corn- and soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0, 0.2, or 0.4% Trp for 4 weeks. The intestinal microbiota was measured by using bacterial 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing methods. Metabolites of Trp and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the hindgut were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography, respectively. The mRNA levels for aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), tumor necrotic factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and protein abundances of tight junction proteins were determined. Results: Compared with the control group, Trp supplementation enhanced piglet growth performance and markedly altered the intestinal microbial composition as evidenced by enhanced alpha and beta diversity in the microbiome (P < 0.05). The abundances of Prevotella, Roseburia, and Succinivibrio genera were enriched, but those of Clostridium sensu stricto and Clostridium Xl, opportunistic pathogens, were decreased with dietary Trp supplementation. Analysis of metabolic pathways indicated enhanced indole alkaloid biosynthesis and Trp metabolism, which was validated by elevated concentrations of 3-indoleacetic acid and indole in the intestinal contents of Trp-supplemented piglets (P < 0.05). These changes in Trp metabolites were correlated with activation of AhR and cytochrome p4501 A1 (CYP1A1) in cecum and colonic tissues, and with a decrease in the intestinal mucosal IL-8 mRNA level. Moreover, the protein abundances for zonula occluden (ZO)-1 and occludin were upregulated by Trp supplementation in colonic tissues. Conclusion: Dietary Trp supplementation altered intestinal microbial composition and diversity, improved intestinal mucosal barrier function, activated AhR signaling, and downregulated expression of inflammatory cytokines in the large intestine of weaned piglets. These results indicate a crosstalk between dietary Trp and intestine in nutrition, microbial metabolism, and mucosal immunity.","2018-08-07","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-19 17:05:43","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-pig gut; var-diet; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effects of insect meal (whose role as alternative feed ingredient is now well recognized) on gut microbiota and mucin composition have recently been reported in Tenebrio molitor-fed free-range and broiler chickens, but no data are currently available for Hermetia illucens (HI)-fed broilers. The present study evaluated the effects of dietary HI meal inclusion on cecal microbiota and intestinal mucin composition of broiler chickens. Results A total of 256 male broiler chickens were allotted to 4 dietary treatments (control diet [C] and 5%, 10% and 15% HI meal inclusion, with 8 replicate pens/treatment and 8 birds/pen) and slaughtered at 35 d of age (2 animals/pen, 16 birds/diet). The cecal microbiota assessment by 16S rRNA amplicon based sequencing showed lower alpha diversity in HI15 chickens (Shannon, P < 0.05) and higher beta diversity (Adonis and ANOSIM, P < 0.001) in birds fed HI diets than C. Furthermore, HI15 birds displayed significant increase of the relative abundance of Proteobacteria phylum (False Discovery Rate [FDR] < 0.05) when compared to HI10. L-Ruminococcus (Ruminococcus from Lachnospiraceae family), Faecalibacterium, Blautia and Clostridium genera were found to be characteristic of HI5 cecal microbiota (FDR < 0.05), while broiler chickens fed HI10 and HI15 diets were characterized (FDR < 0.05) by Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus (HI10) and Bacteroides, Roseburia and Helicobacter genera (HI15). Periodic-acid Schiff, Alcian Blue pH 2.5 and high iron diamine staining on small and large intestine also demonstrated lower mucin staining intensity in the intestinal villi of HI10 and HI15 birds than C (P < 0.05). Conclusions Dietary HI meal utilization at low inclusion levels (i.e., 5%) positively influenced either the cecal microbiota or the gut mucin dynamics in terms of selection of potentially beneficial bacteria and increase in villi mucins. However, high inclusion levels (in particular the 15%) may have a negative influence in terms of partial reduction of microbial complexity, reduction of potentially beneficial bacteria, selection of bacteria with mucolytic activity and decrease in villi mucins.","2020-02-03","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-19 14:40:26","","","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodology Twenty-eight male apoE(-/-) mice were divided into two groups with 14 in each: CAP group and control group. In the CAP group, sterile cotton wool containing 10(8) colony-forming units of P. gingivalis was placed into the pulp chamber after pulp exposure followed by coronal resin filling in bilateral maxillary first and second molars. The mice were fed with a chow diet to induce atherosclerosis. Animals were euthanized 16 weeks after the operation, and the periapical lesions of bilateral maxillary first and second molars were assessed by micro-CT. After collection of aortic arches, atherosclerotic lesions were measured by Oil Red O staining. Serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) were measured. Stools were collected to detect alterations in gut microbiota by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Independent samples t-test was used to calculate the difference between the two groups. Results CAP was observed in 98.2% of molars. A significant increase in atherosclerotic plaque formation in the aortic arches was found in the CAP groups (CAP: 2.001% +/- 0.27%, control: 0.927% +/- 0.22%, p = .005).

Here, we investigated the specific relationship between the IF and infantile spasms (IS), a specific form of epilepsy. Methods: Twenty-three children suffering from IS were recruited from the Chinese PLA General Hospital. According to patient response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment, the cohort was subdivided into 2 groups: an ACTH-response group and an ACTH-no response (NR) group. A total of 21 healthy children were recruited as a control group (healthy controls: HCs) during the same time period. Fecal samples were collected from infants in the IS and HC groups, and the population of fecal microorganisms was analyzed by 16s ribosomal DNA sequencing. The alpha and beta diversity of the fecal microflora was determined, and the relative abundance of each species was classified. Tax4Fun2 was used to analyze the metabolic pathways utilized by the microflora, and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database was used to analyze differentially expressed genes and pathways. Results: No significant differences existed in alpha or beta diversity when compared between the IS and HC groups, nor between the ACTH-response and ACTH-NR groups which were separated before and after ACTH treatment. Although there was no significant difference between the ACTH-response and ACTHNR groups with respect to a diversity, there was a significant difference in beta diversity. Compared with that of the HCs, the IF of the IS group featured lower proportions of Lactobacillus, Roseburia, and Lachnospira, and a higher proportion of Clostridium. In the IS group, the proportion of Staphylococcus in the IF was higher before treatment than after treatment. Compared with the ACTH-NR group, the ACTH-response group had reduced populations of Odoribacter, Phascolarctobacterium, Anaerotruncus, Mitsuakella, and Robinsoniella. However, an increase was observed in the population of Bifidobacterium. A significant difference was also identified between the IS and HC groups with regard to the expression levels of genes associated with lipoic acid synthesis.

A longitudinal study was designed to assess how BKG affects rumen bacterial communities and average daily gain (ADG) in beef cattle. At weaning, 38 calves were randomly assigned to three BKG systems for 55 days (d): a high roughage diet within a dry lot (DL, n = 13); annual cover crop within a strip plot (CC, n = 13); and perennial pasture vegetation within rotational paddocks (PP, n = 12), as before weaning. After BKG, all calves were placed in a feedlot for 142 d and finished with a high energy ration. Calves were weighed periodically from weaning to finishing to determine ADG. Rumen bacterial communities were profiled by collecting fluid samples via oral probe and sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene, at weaning, during BKG and finishing. Results Rumen bacterial communities diverged drastically among calves once they were placed in each BKG system, including sharp decreases in alpha diversity for CC and DL calves only (P < 0.001). During BKG, DL calves showed a substantial increase of Proteobacteria (Succinivibrionaceae family) (P < 0.001), which also corresponded with greater ADG (P < 0.05). At the finishing stage, Proteobacteria bloomed for all calves, with no previous alpha or beta diversity differences being retained between groups. However, at finishing, PP calves showed a compensatory ADG, particularly greater than that in calves coming from DL BKG (P = 0.02). Microbiome network traits such as lower average shortest path length, and increased neighbor connectivity, degree, number and strength of bacterial interactions between rumen bacteria better predicted ADG during BKG and finishing than variation in specific taxonomic profiles. Conclusions Bacterial co-abundance interactions, as measured by network theory approaches, better predicted growth performance in beef cattle during BKG and finishing, than the abundance of specific taxa. These findings underscore the importance of early post weaning stages as potential targets for feeding interventions that can enhance metabolic interactions between rumen bacteria, to increase productive performance in beef cattle.","2022-03-28","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-06-30 19:12:52","","","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle rumen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metagenomic DNA was extracted from tobacco leaf samples and sequenced by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Our results showed that bacterial communities of cigar tobacco phyllosphere in GC exhibited remarkably higher alpha diversity than that in WZS. There was slight effect of tobacco genotype variations on the alpha diversity in both cultivation sites, and beta diversity and structure of bacterial community were not influenced significantly by the cultivation sites and tobacco varieties. Statistical analyses of species diversity unraveled that the dominant species in bacterial communities of cigar tobacco phyllosphere among all these samples were phylogenetically affiliated to Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria. At the genus level, the most abundant microorganism was Limnobacter, followed by Brevundimonas, unidentified_Cyanobacteria, and Pseudomonas. Additionally, environmental conditions except for humidity were negatively correlated with the relative abundance of bacterial genera.

To what extent such findings reflect true biological phenomena or methodological artifacts remains unclear. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing the turnover of soil bacterial communities from three data sets. We applied three methodological innovations: (i) design of a hierarchical sampling scheme to disentangle environmental from spatial factors driving turnover; (ii) resolution of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants to enable higher-resolution community profiling; and (iii) application of the new metric zeta diversity to analyze multisite turnover and drivers. At fine taxonomic resolution, rapid compositional turnover was observed across multiple spatial scales. Turnover was overwhelmingly driven by deterministic processes and influenced by the rare biosphere. The communities also exhibited strong distance decay patterns and taxon-area relationships, with z values within the interquartile range reported for macroorganisms. These biogeographical patterns were weakened upon applying two standard approaches to process community sequencing data: clustering sequences at 97% identity threshold and/or filtering the rare biosphere (sequences lower than 0.05% relative abundance). Comparable findings were made across local, regional, and global data sets and when using shotgun metagenomic markers. Altogether, these findings suggest that bacteria exhibit strong biogeographic patterns, but these signals can be obscured by methodological limitations. We advocate various innovations, including using zeta diversity, to advance the study of microbial biogeography. IMPORTANCE It is commonly thought that bacterial distributions show lower spatial variation than for multicellular organisms. In this article, we present evidence that these inferences are artifacts caused by methodological limitations. Through leveraging innovations in sampling design, sequence processing, and diversity analysis, we provide multifaceted evidence that bacterial communities in fact exhibit strong distribution patterns. This is driven by selection due to factors such as local soil characteristics. Altogether, these findings suggest that the processes underpinning diversity patterns are more unified across all domains of life than previously thought, which has broad implications for the understanding and management of soil biodiversity.","2020-08","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-06-30 17:03:41","","","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-geography; zeta diversity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, it affects gut microbiota configuration. Thus, whey protein is considered as good dietary candidate to prevent or ameliorate metabolic diseases, such as obesity. However, the relationship that links energy balance, metabolism, and intestinal microbial population mediated by whey protein intake remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects attributed to whey protein in the context of high-fat diet (HFD) in mice at two different ages, with short or longer durations of whey protein supplementation. Here, a 5-week dietary intervention with HFD in combination with either whey protein isolate (WPI) or the control nonwhey milk protein casein (CAS) was performed using 5-week or 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice. Notably, the younger mice had no prior history of ingestion of WPI, while older mice did. 5-week-old HFD-WPI-fed mice showed a decrease in weight gain and changes in the expression of genes within the epidydimal white adipose tissue including those encoding leptin, inflammatory marker CD68, fasting-induced adipose factor FIAF and enzymes involved in fatty acids catabolism, relative to HFD-CAS-fed mice. Differences in beta-diversity and higher proportions of Lactobacillus murinus, and related functions, were evident within the gut microbiota of HFD-WPI mice. However, none of these changes were observed in mice that started the HFD dietary intervention at 10-weeks-old, with an extended period of WPI supplementation. These results suggest that the effect of whey protein on mouse body weight, adipose tissue, and intestinal parameters depends on diet duration and stage of life during which the diet is provided. In some instances, WPI influences gut microbiota composition and functional potential, which might orchestrate observed metabolic and physiological modifications.","2020-08","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-19 14:54:29","","","","15","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-rodent gut; shotgun sequencing; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the underlying beneficial effects of combined probiotic and dietary intervention on the gut microbiota of `non-patient' individuals previously on an HFD have yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, fecal samples were obtained from 36 volunteers on a high-fat diet and after dietary intervention for 4 months, and 16S rDNA sequencing was applied to identify how probiotics and dietary intervention had altered the composition of the microbiota. The results demonstrated that probiotics treatment and dietary intervention in combination raised the diversity of lumen microbes compared with their individual applications. A markedly separated distribution (beta-diversity) was observed, confirming the difference in gut microbiota composition among the treatment groups. Bacterial taxonomic analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of 30 species was altered among the groups following dietary intervention and/or probiotic supplementation. The majority of the species that exhibited a population increase belonged to two butyrate-producing families, Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, whereas the species with reduced populations mainly belonged to the Bacteroidaceae family. Collectively, these results suggest that combined probiotic and dietary intervention is able to improve the gut microbiota composition of human subjects on an HFD.","2019-09","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-19 15:09:12","","2262-2270","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-diet; var-probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The adult parasite mainly inhabits the bile duct and gall bladder, and results in various complications to the hepatobiliary system. The amount of bile secreted into the intestine is reduced in cases of C. sinensis infection, which may alter the pH of the gut and decrease the amount of surfactant protein D released from the gallbladder. However, the impact of parasitic infection on the human gut microbiome remains unclear. To this end, we examined the gut microbiota composition in 47 modified KatoKatz thick smear-positive (egg-positive) volunteers and 42 healthy controls from five rural communities. Subjects were grouped into four sub-populations based on age and infection status. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant changes in alpha diversity between EP1 and EN1. The beta diversity showed alterations between C. sinensis-infected subjects and healthy controls. In C. sinensis infected patients, we found the significant reduction of certain taxa, such as Bacteroides and anti-inflammatory Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). Bacteroides, a predominant gut bacteria in healthy populations, was negatively correlated with the number of C. sinensis eggs per gram (EPG, r = -0.37, P adjust < 0.01 in 20-60 years old group; r = -0.64, P adjust = 0.04 in the 60+ years old group). What's more, the reduction in the abundance of Bifidobacterium, a common probiotic, was decreased particularly in the 60 + years old group (r = -0.50, P = 0.04). The abundance of Dorea, a potentially pro-inflammatory microbe, was higher in infected subjects than in healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Variovorax was a unique bacteria that was only detected in infected subjects. These results clearly demonstrate the significant influence of C. sinensis infection on the human gut microbiota and provided new insights into the control, prevention, diagnosis, and clinical study of clonorchiasis through the human gut microbiota.","2018-09-28","2022-06-27 16:29:10","2022-07-18 22:01:49","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Healthy horses were treated for 5 days with enrofloxacin, ceftiofur sodium, oxytetracycline and saline solution, and fecal samples were collected over 30 days. Microbiome analysis was carried out via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microbial diversity and abundance were altered using ceftiofur and enrofloxacin. This study showed that antimicrobials alter gut bacterial communities, which could predispose horses to gastrointestinal inflammation, diarrhea and possibly systemic disorders. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota after antimicrobial therapy in horses can result in loss of colonization resistance and changes in bacterial metabolic function. It is hypothesized that these changes facilitate gastrointestinal inflammation, pathogen expansion and the development of diarrhea. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of intravenous administration of antimicrobial drugs (ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, oxytetracycline) on equine fecal bacterial communities over time, to investigate whether those changes are detectable after 5 days of treatment and whether they persist over time (30 days). Sixteen horses were randomly assigned into 4 treatment groups: group 1 (enrofloxacin, n = 4); group 2 (ceftiofur sodium, n = 4); group 3 (oxytetracycline, n = 4); group 4 (0.9% saline solution, placebo, n = 4). Antimicrobial therapy was administered for 5 days. Fecal samples were obtained before (day 0) and at 3, 5 and 30 days of the study period. Bacterial DNA was amplified using specific primers to the hypervariable region V1-V3 of the 16S rRNA gene using a 454 FLX-Titanium pyrosequencer. Antimicrobial therapy failed to cause any changes in physical examination parameters, behavior, appetite or fecal output or consistency throughout the study in any horse. There was a significant effect of treatment on alpha diversity indices (richness) over the treatment interval for ceftiofur on days 0 vs. 3 (p < 0.05), but not for other antimicrobials (p > 0.05). Microbial composition was significantly different (p < 0.05) across treatment group and day, but not for interactions between treatment and day, regardless of taxonomic level and beta-diversity distance metric. The most significant antimicrobial effects on relative abundance were noted after intravenous administration of ceftiofur and enrofloxacin. The relative abundance of Fibrobacteres was markedly lower on day 3 compared to other days in the ceftiofur and enrofloxacin treatment groups. There was an increase in Clostridia and Lachnospiraceae from day 0 to days 3 and 5 in ceftiofur and enrofloxacin treated groups. These findings showed the negative effect of antimicrobial drugs on bacterial communities associated with gut health (Fibrobacteres and Lachnospiraceae) and indicate that changes in specific taxa could predispose horses to gastrointestinal inflammation and the development of diarrhea.","2022-04","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-07-18 22:15:20","","","","8","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; var-antibiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The importance of the rumen microbiota (RM) is also widely recognized for its critical roles in metabolism and immunity. The level of health is indicated by a dynamic RM distribution. We performed high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to compare microbial populations between rumens in beef cattle with or without doxycycline treatment to assess dynamic microbiotic shifts following antibiotic administration. The results of the operational taxonomic unit analysis and alpha and beta diversity calculations showed that doxycycline-treated beef cattle had lower species richness and bacterial diversity than those without doxycycline. Bacteroidetes was the predominant phylum in rumen samples without doxycycline, while Proteobacteria was the governing phylum in the presence of doxycycline. On the family level, the top three predominant populations in group qlqlwy (not treated with doxycycline) were Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae, compared to Xanthomonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rikenellaceae in group qlhlwy (treated with doxycycline). At the genus level, the top predominant population in group qlqlwy was unidentified_Prevotellaceae. However, in group qlhlwy, the top predominant population was Stenotrophomonas. The results revealed significant RM differences in beef cattle with or without doxycycline. Oral doxycycline may induce RM composition differences, and bacterial richness may also influence corresponding changes that could guide antibiotic use in adult ruminants. This study is the first to assess microbiota distribution in beef cattle rumen after doxycycline administration.","2020-06-02","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-29 17:07:55","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle rumen; var-antibiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cholesteatoma is a non-cancerous, cyst-like lesion in the ME that may be acquired due to chronic OM and cause disabling complications. Surgery is required for treatment, with high rates of recurrence. Current antibiotic treatments have been largely targeted to previous culturable bacteria, which may lead to antibiotic resistance or treatment failures. For this study, our goal was to determine the microbiota of cholesteatoma tissue in comparison with other ME tissues in patients with long-standing chronic OM. ME samples including cholesteatoma, granulation tissue, ME mucosa and discharge were collected from patients undergoing tympanomastoidectomy surgery for chronic OM. Bacteria were profiled by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 103 ME samples from 53 patients. Respiratory viruses were also screened in 115 specimens from 45 patients. Differences in bacterial profiles (beta-diversity) and the relative abundances of individual taxa were observed between cholesteatoma and ME sample-types. Additionally, patient age was associated with differences in overall microbiota composition while numerous individual taxa were differentially abundant across age quartiles. No viruses were identified in screened ME samples. Biodiversity was moderately lower in cholesteatoma and ME discharge compared to ME mucosal tissues. We also present overall bacterial profiles of ME tissues by sample-type, age, cholesteatoma diagnosis and quinolone use, including prevalent bacterial taxa. Our findings will be useful for fine-tuning treatment protocols for cholesteatoma and chronic OM in settings with limited health care resources.","2022-04-19","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-07-19 17:58:16","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human ear; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sample consisted of 75 children, aged between 7 and 16, of whom 25 had nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), 25 had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 25 were obese and without NAFLD. These groups were matched by age, sex, and body mass index. Data were collected between June, 2019 and December, 2019 at the Hunan Children's Hospital, in China. Microbiome composition in fecal samples was assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. In the clinical indices, 12 glucose and lipid metabolism indices were included, and six water-electrolyte metabolism indices were included. The results indicated that microbiomes of NAFLD children had lower alpha diversity but higher beta diversity index than the other two groups. Specifically, anti-inflammatory and probiotics abundance (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium_adolescentis) was significantly decreased in NAFLD, whereas the abundance of harmful bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcaceae) was increased. Moreover, the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Roseburia_inulinivorans, Roseburia_intestinalis, and Coprococcus_comes) was significantly decreased in NASH. The abundance of these bacteria were associated with glucose, lipid, and water-electrolyte metabolism (e.g., glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, inorganic salt, total body water, etc.), implying that the NAFLD and its severity were associated with glucose, lipid, and water-electrolyte metabolism dysbiosis.

Results: Alterations in nasal microbiota but not of throat microbiota were associated with asthma. Children with asthma had lower alpha- and beta-diversity of the nasal microbiota as compared with healthy control children. Furthermore, asthma presence was positively associated with a specific operational taxonomic unit from the genus Moraxella in children not exposed to farming, whereas in farm children Moraxella colonization was unrelated to asthma. In nonfarm children, Moraxella colonization explained the association between bacterial diversity and asthma to a large extent. Conclusions: Asthma was mainly associated with an altered nasal microbiota characterized by lower diversity and Moraxella abundance.

Recently, we demonstrated that xylanase/glucanase addition in wheat-based diet improved nutrient digestibility, arabinoxylan fermentability and broiler growth. Conversely, maize arabinoxylan was found to be recalcitrant to xylanase action. These findings suggested that enzyme-mediated improvement of nutrient digestion and carbohydrate fermentation depended on the cereal type present in the diet, and may have contributed to broiler growth. Hence, we aimed at further investigating the link between dietary enzymes and carbohydrate fermentation in broilers, by studying the impact of enzyme supplementation in cereal-based diets, to the microbial communities in the ileum and ceca of broilers. For that purpose, 96 one-day-old male broilers were randomly reared in two pens and received either wheat-based or maize-based starter and grower diets. At d 20, the broilers were randomly assigned to one out of four dietary treatments. The broilers received for 8 d the wheat-based or maize-based finisher diet as such (Control treatments; WC, MC) or supplemented with a xylanase/glucanase combination (Enzyme treatments; WE, ME). At d 28, samples from the digestive tract were collected, and the ileal and cecal microbiota composition was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing. A similar phylogenetic (alpha) diversity was observed among the four treatments, both in the ileal and the cecal samples. Furthermore, a similar microbial composition in the ileum (beta diversity) was observed, with lactobacilli being the predominant community for all treatments. In contrast, both cereal type and enzyme supplementation were found to influence cecal communities. The type of cereal (i.e., wheat or maize) explained 47% of the total variation in microbial composition in the ceca. Further stratifying the analysis per cereal type revealed differences in microbiota composition between WC and WE, but not between MC and ME. Furthermore, the prevalence of beneficial genera, such as Faecalibacterium and Blautia, in the ceca of broilers fed wheat-based diets coincided with arabinoxylan accumulation. These findings indicated that fermentable arabinoxylan and arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides released by dietary xylanase may play an important role in bacterial metabolism.","2022-05-04","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-30 19:02:40","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut; var-diet; var-prebiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rabbit younglings are born with a sterile digestive tract but then it gets progressively colonised by the microbiota of the nursing mother, by entering in contact with or ingesting the maternal droppings present in the nest. Here we posit that (i) offspring survival and (ii) lifespan of female rabbits are linked to how diverse their microbiota are. To test the hypothesis that maternal microbiota evolves in females having had different levels of offspring survival in their lifetime, we obtained 216 hard faecal samples from 75 female rabbits at ages 19.6, 31.6, 62.6 and 77.6 weeks. The annual mean offspring survival (MOS) at 64 days was calculated for each female then crossed against three alpha-diversity indexes (operational taxonomic units (OTUs), inverse Simpson index and Shannon index). Age was also analysed against these three parameters. The alpha-diversity indexes of the female faecal microbiota did not correlate with MOS, but they did decrease with age (e.g. from 712 OTUs at age 19.6 weeks to 444 OTUs at 77.6 weeks;P< 0.05). The age effect was also found in beta-diversity non-metric multidimensional scaling plots using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and the unweighted UniFrac index but not for MOS. The ability of the microbiota composition from the faecal samples of young females (19.6 weeks old) to predict their lifespan was also evaluated. After subdividing the initial population into two classes (females that weaned a maximum of three litters and females living longer), we found no clear distinction between these two classes.

However, the effect of press disturbances in community assembly mechanisms, particularly with regard to taxa and functional genes at different levels of abundance (i.e., common and rare), remains largely unknown. Here, we tested the effect of a continuous alteration in substrate feeding scheme on the structure, function, and assembly of bacterial communities. Two sets of replicate 5-liter sequencing batch reactors were operated at two different organic carbon loads for a period of 74 days, following 53 days of acclimation after inoculation with sludge from a full-scale treatment plant. Temporal dynamics of community taxonomic and functional gene structure were derived from metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding data. Disturbed reactors exhibited different community function, structure, and assembly compared to undisturbed reactors. Bacterial taxa and functional genes showed dissimilar alpha-diversity and community assembly patterns. Deterministic assembly mechanisms were generally stronger in disturbed reactors and in common fractions compared to rare ones. Function quickly recovered after the disturbance was removed, but community structure did not. Our results highlight that functional gene data from metagenomics can indicate patterns of community assembly that differ from those obtained from taxon data. This study reveals how a joint evaluation of assembly mechanisms and community structure of bacterial taxa and functional genes as well as ecosystem function can unravel the response of complex microbial systems to a press disturbance. IMPORTANCE Ecosystem management must be viewed in the context of increasing frequencies and magnitudes of various disturbances that occur at different scales. This work provides a glimpse of the changes in assembly mechanisms found in microbial communities exposed to sustained changes in their environment. These mechanisms, deterministic or stochastic, can cause communities to reach a similar or variable composition and function. For a comprehensive view, we use a joint evaluation of temporal dynamics in assembly mechanisms and community structure for both bacterial taxa and their functional genes at different abundance levels, in both disturbed and undisturbed states. We further reverted the disturbance state to contrast recovery of function with community structure. Our findings are relevant, as very few studies have employed such an approach, while there is a need to assess the relative importance of assembly mechanisms for microbial communities across different spatial and temporal scales, environmental gradients, and types of disturbance.","2020-08","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-28 20:56:09","","","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, we compared the species numbers, microbial diversity, GM composition at genus and species-level, and functional metabolic pathways in the two groups. The results showed that the species number was lower in the OP group (1272) than in the control group (1413), and 1002 GM species were shared between the two groups. The OP group had the decreased alpha diversity compared with the control group. As for beta diversity, The PCA revealed that samples in the two groups had distinguishable ecological distance in each coordinate. At the species level, Bacteroide coprocola (B. coprocola), Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), Parabacteroides distasonis (P. distasonis), and Prevotella copri (P. copri) were higher in the OP group, while Corynebacterium stationis (C. stationis), Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), and Alistipes indistinctus (A. indistinctus) were decreased. Moreover, functional metabolic analysis revealed that metabolic pathways of fatty acid biosynthesis, valine/isoleucine biosynthesis, GABA biosynthesis, and ubiquinone biosynthesis were enriched in the senile osteoporotic rats. In conclusion, GM at the species level in senile osteoporotic rats was significantly altered in structure, composition, and function. The altered GM structure, increased GM species such as P. copri, and decreased GM species such as A. muciniphila might be linked with the development of senile osteoporosis.","2022-04","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-07-19 15:07:24","","","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; shotgun sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to determine which of two commonly used sampling sites (dental plaque vs. oral swab) would provide a better prediction model for caries-free vs. severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) using next generation sequencing and machine learning (ML). In this cross-sectional study, a total of 80 children (40 S-ECC and 40 caries-free) < 72 months of age were recruited. Supragingival plaque and oral swab samples were used for the amplicon sequencing of the V4-16S rRNA and ITS1 rRNA genes. The results showed significant differences in alpha and beta diversity between dental plaque and oral swab bacterial and fungal microbiomes. Differential abundance analyses showed that, among others, the cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans was enriched in the dental plaque, compared to oral swabs, of children with S-ECC. The fungal species Candida dubliniensis and C. tropicalis were more abundant in the oral swab samples of children with S-ECC compared to caries-free controls. They were also among the top 20 most important features for the classification of S-ECC vs. caries-free in oral swabs and for the classification of dental plaque vs. oral swab in the S-ECC group. ML approaches revealed the possibility of classifying samples according to both caries status and sampling sites. The tested site of sample collection did not change the predictability of the disease. However, the species considered to be important for the classification of disease in each sampling site were slightly different. Being able to determine the origin of the samples could be very useful during the design of oral microbiome studies. This study provides important insights into the differences between the dental plaque and oral swab bacteriome and mycobiome of children with S-ECC and those caries-free.","2021-06-25","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-30 19:52:31","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients and methods: A nested case-control cohort of 40 patients with RA and 40 sex-age matched controls was studied. Subjects with diabetes, with any other inflammatory disease, practicing extreme diets, taking antibiotics, probiotics or under any new treatment for at least three months prior to sampling were excluded. The microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and bioinformatics analysis by Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME). Other variables included clinical-laboratory variables and average Disease Activity Score 28 points during the follow-up period. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to investigate the possible risk factors for the microbiota. Results: beta-diversity data showed that patients tend to differ from healthy subjects according to their microbiota (p = 0.07). The analysis showed an increase in Collinsella aerofaciens, Sedimentibacter and Enterococcus genera in patients compared to controls, as well as a decrease in Dorea formicigenerans. Likewise, an increase in the activity of arginine deiminase was observed, which was found in approximately 90% of the RA genes of the genus Collinsela. The sequence number of Collinsella aerofaciens was independently associated with age (B (95%CI), -0.347 (-21.6, -2.1)), high ACPA (0.323 (27.4-390.0)) and smoking (0.300 (8.8-256.4)) in RA patients. In addition, we observed decreases in Sarcina, 02d06 and Porphyromonas bacterial lineages. Conclusion: Patients with RA present dysbiosis, resulting from an abundance of certain bacterial lineages and a decrease in others. These alterations could influence the maintenance of autoimmunity to this disease.","2020-04","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-30 18:45:28","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies regarding gut microbiomes of different animals have provided ecological and evolutionary information showing a strong link between health and disease. Very few studies have compared the gut microbiota of animals housed under controlled conditions and those in wild habitats. Little research has been performed on the reptile gut microbiota, and what studies do exist are mainly focused on carnivorous reptiles. The aim of this study was first to describe the overall microbiota structure of Aldabra giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea) and, second, to compare the microbiota of tortoises living under natural conditions and tortoises living in controlled environments, such as zoological and botanical parks, in Italy and in the Seychelles. Seventeen fecal samples were collected from giant tortoises located on Curieuse Island (CI, n = 8), at the Botanical Garden (BG, n = 3) in Mahe (Seychelles Islands) and at Parco Natura Viva-Garda Zoological Park (PNV, n = 6) in Verona (Italy). The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified in order to characterize the gut microbiota profile. Overall, the major phyla identified were Bacteroidetes 42%, Firmicutes 32%, and Spirochaetes 9%. A higher microbial diversity (alpha indices) was observed for the BG samples as compared to the PNV samples (Shannon: 5.39 vs. 4.43; InvSimpson: 80.7 vs. 25; Chao1: 584 vs. 377 p < 0.05). The results in the present study showed a significant difference in beta diversity between the samples from CI, BG, and PNV (p = 0.001), suggesting a different bacterial fecal profile of giant tortoises at the different habitats. This study provided novel insights into the effects of different environmental conditions on the gut microbial communities of giant tortoises. In particular, differences were reported regarding the bacterial gut community structure between tortoises in natural and in controlled environments. These results could help to improve the management of giant tortoises under human care, thus enhancing ex-situ conservation efforts far from the species geographic range.","2020-10-20","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-07-18 22:21:29","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-turtle gut; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, community diversity is believed to relate to ecosystem functions, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we tested the effect of disturbance on the structure, assembly, and ecosystem function of complex microbial communities within an engineered system. We carried out a microcosm experiment where activated sludge bioreactors operated in daily cycles were subjected to eight different frequency levels of augmentation with a toxic pollutant, from never (undisturbed) to every day (press-disturbed), for 35 days. Microbial communities were assessed by combining distance-based methods, general linear multivariate models, alpha-diversity indices, and null model analyses on metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene amplicon data. A stronger temporal decrease in alpha-diversity at the extreme, undisturbed and press-disturbed, ends of the disturbance range led to a hump-backed pattern, with the highest diversity found at intermediate levels of disturbance. Undisturbed and press-disturbed levels displayed the highest community and functional similarity across replicates, suggesting deterministic processes were dominating. The opposite was observed amongst intermediately disturbed levels, indicating stronger stochastic assembly mechanisms. Trade-offs were observed in the ecosystem function between organic carbon removal and both nitrification and biomass productivity, as well as between diversity and these functions. Hence, not every ecosystem function was favoured by higher community diversity. Our results show that the assessment of changes in diversity, along with the underlying stochastic-deterministic assembly processes, is essential to understanding the impact of disturbance in complex microbial communities.","2019-02-11","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-30 17:01:44","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach is known as blanket dry-cow therapy, usually effective for the prevention and cure of infections, but has been shown to potentially contribute to the emergence and spreading of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. Exploring the use of non-antibiotic treatments coupled with selective dry-cow therapy is necessary to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance and potential interference with milk microbiome balance. The impact of selective dry-cow therapy on the physiological milk microbiome needs to be carefully evaluated. In this small-scale trial, five healthy (no mastits, SCC <200,000 cells mL(-1)) second-parity cows from dry-off to 5 days after calving were sampled. For every cow, each quarter received a different treatment: (i) bismuth salnitrate (internal teat sealant, OrbSeal (R), Zoetis, Italy), front right quarter; (ii) cephalonium dihydrate (Cepravin (R), MSD, Italy), rear right quarter; (iii) benzathine cloxacillin (Cloxalene dry, Ati, Italy), rear left quarter. No treatment was applied to the remaining quarter (front left) which served as experimental control. For 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bacterial DNA was extracted from 5 ml of milk samples, amplified using the primers for the V3-V4 hypervariable regions and sequenced in one MiSeq (Illumina) run with 2 x 250-base paired-end reads. Bacteriological results confirmed that the quarters were all healthy. The phylaProteobacteria, Firmicutes, andActinobacteriawere the most abundant for all treatments and controls at all three timepoints, accounting for over 80% of the entire milk microbiota composition. No significant differences were found between treatments and controls in terms of the major alpha and beta diversity indexes, revealing that antibiotic, and non-antibiotic treatments for selective dry-cow therapy did not alter significantly the milk microbiome of dairy cows. The milk microbiota composition showed a clear evolution over the lactation cycle, and the overall changes in the milk microbiota diversity over the lactation cycle were mainly independent of treatments.","2020-09-02","2022-06-27 16:29:11","2022-06-30 16:52:39","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cow milk; var-antibiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to examine the effects of an 8-week aerobic exercise intervention on insulin sensitivity, visceral adiposity, and gut microbiota diversity and composition in participants with obesity. Methods Fourteen participants (mean [SD], age 51 [11] years; BMI 34.9 [4.9] kg/m(2)) performed an 8-week exercise intervention (2 to 4 times/week on 65% to 85% of heart rate reserve). Insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulemic euglycemic clamp), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen uptake), visceral adiposity (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan) and gut microbiota composition (16S rRNA gene sequencing) were measured before and after the intervention. Results Insulin sensitivity showed a significant increase (pre: 3.8 [1.9] mg/min/kg; post: 4.5 [1.7] mg/min/kg; p = 0.007) after training, whereas visceral adiposity decreased (pre: 959 [361] cm(3); post: 897 [364] cm(3); p = 0.02). No change in gut microbiota alpha- or beta-diversity was found. At the genus level, the abundance of Ruminococcus gauvreauii (p = 0.02); Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group (p = 0.04), and Anaerostipes (p = 0.04) significantly increased after exercise training. Significant positive correlations were present for M-value (R. gauvreauii) and VO2 max (R. gauvreauii and Anaerostipes).

Results: A reduction of both alpha- and beta-diversity in CD, already evident in the potential form and achieving nadir in refractory CD, was evident. Taxonomically, mucosa displayed a significant abundance of Proteobacteria and an expansion of Neisseria, especially in active patients, while treated celiacs showed an intermediate profile between active disease and controls. The saliva community mirrored the mucosal one better than stool. Conclusion: Expansion of pathobiontic species anticipates villous atrophy and achieves the maximal divergence from controls in refractory CD. Gluten-free diet results in incomplete recovery.

This study aims to explore how ocular surface Demodex infestation (DI) affects ocular surface microbial communities and diversity. Methods We recruited 255 subjects, and examined the correlation between ocular surface mite infestation and clinical indicators such as age, blood glucose level, dry eye symptoms, and blood pressure. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on the conjunctival swab samples of 14 patients with ocular DI (P group) and 17 healthy people (N group). For further analysis, the subjects were divided into four subgroups, i.e. N-NMGD (n = 11), N-MGD (n = 6), P-NMGD (n = 6), and P-MGD (n = 8), according to meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) or no MGD (NMGD). Results There was no difference in the alpha-diversity of ocular surface microbial communities between the DI and healthy control groups. In linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), there were more Acinetobacter, Novosphingobium, and Anoxybacillus in the DI group and fewer Novosphingobium, Lactobacillus, and Candidatus Microthrix in the healthy control group. P-NMGD had more Thermaceae and fewer Pseudomonas than P-MGD. There were more Bacteroidetes in N-NMGD than in N-MGD. The alpha-diversity of P-NMGD was lower than that of N-NMGD (Shannon index, P = 0.027). At the same time, the alpha-diversity of N-MGD was lower than that of N-NMGD (Shannon, Simpson, and dominance index, P = 0.048). There was no significant difference in beta-diversity or in the primary flora at the phylum and genus levels between groups and subgroups. Conclusion DI had no significant effect on the diversity of ocular surface microbial communities. DI primarily changed the dominant flora and relative abundance of ocular surface microbial communities. MGD may play an important role in this process.","2021-09","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 17:38:08","","601-617","","3","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human ocular; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, selection of plant genotypes that promote microbial species involved in root-adhering soil aggregation and rhizosheath formation could help improve yield sustainably. Here, we tested pearl millet genotypic variation in both root-adhering soil aggregation, microbiological and biochemical characteristics. Methods A collection of 181 pearl millet inbred lines was phenotyped for their rhizosheath size, and 13 contrasting genotypes were selected and grown under field conditions, and their root-adhering soil (RAS) was sampled. Microbial biomass, pH, mineral N content and six enzymatic activities involved in main nutrients cycles were analyzed, and metabarcoding of 16S rDNA and ITS were performed for bacterial and fungal diversity. Results Enzymatic activities (chitinase, acid phosphomonoesterase, FDA-hydrolysis and beta-glucosidase) were higher in RAS of larger rhizosheath lines than that of smaller rhizosheath one. Bacterial beta-diversity showed a separation of the most contrasting lines in the principal coordinate analysis performed with the Bray-Curtis distance matrix. Some bacteria from the Gaiellaceae and Sphingomonadaceae families and the Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium genera were associated with the large rhizosheath phenotype. Concerning the fungal community, we noticed a negative correlation between the specific richness and the rhizosheath size and Trichoderma genus was positively associated to the rhizosheath size.

Here, we examine how natural temperature fluctuations might be related to changes in skin bacterial diversity over time in three amphibian populations infected by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Our focal host species (Eleutherodactylus coqui) is a direct-developing frog that has suffered declines at some populations in the last 20 years, while others have not experienced any changes. We quantified skin bacterial alpha-and beta-diversity at four sampling time points, a period encompassing two seasons and ample variation in natural infections and environmental conditions. Despite the different patterns of infection across populations, we detected an overall increase in bacterial diversity through time, characterized by the replacement of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Increased frog body temperatures possibly allowed the colonization of bacteria as well as the recruitment of a subset of indicator OTUs, which could have promoted the observed changes in diversity patterns. Our results suggest that natural environmental fluctuations might be involved in creating opportunities for bacterial replacement, potentially attenuating pathogen transmission and thus contributing to host persistence in E. coqui populations.","2017-09","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-06-30 18:36:46","","4787-4797","","18","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-amphibian skin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we measured physicochemical properties and bacterial community composition of sediment samples taken from twenty-eight streams within the Marcellus shale formation in northeastern Pennsylvania differentially impacted by hydraulic fracturing activities. Fourteen of the streams were classified as UOG+, and thirteen were classified as UOG based on the presence of UOG extraction in their respective watersheds. One stream was located in a watershed that previously had UOG extraction activities but was recently abandoned. We utilized high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to infer differences in sediment aquatic bacterial community structure between UOG+ and UOG streams, as well as correlate bacterial community structure to physicochemical water parameters. Although overall alpha and beta diversity differences were not observed, there were a plethora of significantly enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within UOG+ and UOG samples. Our biomarker analysis revealed many of the bacterial taxa enriched in UOG+ streams can live in saline conditions, such as Rubrobacteraceae. In addition, several bacterial taxa capable of hydrocarbon degradation were also enriched in UOG+ samples, including Oceanospirillaceae. Methanotrophic taxa, such as Methylococcales, were significantly enriched as well. Several taxa that were identified as enriched in these samples were enriched in samples taken from different streams in 2014; moreover, partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed clustering between streams from the different studies based on the presence of hydraulic fracturing along the second axis.

Recent small-scale studies suggest that LEDs are associated with marked changes in the gut microbiota that may modify the effect of the LED on host metabolism and weight loss. We investigated how the gut microbiota changed during 8 weeks of total meal replacement LED and determined their associations with host response in a sub-analysis of 211 overweight adults with pre-diabetes participating in the large multicentre PREVIEW (PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle intervention and population studies In Europe and around the World) clinical trial. Methods: Microbial community composition was analysed by Illumina sequencing of the hypervariable V3-V4 regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Butyrate production capacity was estimated by qPCR targeting the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene. Bioinformatics and statistical analyses, such as comparison of alpha and beta diversity measures, correlative and differential abundances analysis, were undertaken on the 16S rRNA gene sequences of 211 paired (pre- and post-LED) samples as well as their integration with the clinical, biomedical and dietary datasets for predictive modelling. Results: The overall composition of the gut microbiota changed markedly and consistently from pre- to post-LED (P = 0.001), along with increased richness and diversity (both P < 0.001). Following the intervention, the relative abundance of several genera previously associated with metabolic improvements (e.g., Akkermansia and Christensenellaceae R-7 group) was significantly increased (P < 0.001), while flagellated Pseudobutyrivibrio, acetogenic Blautia and Bifidobacterium spp. were decreased (all P < 0.001). Butyrate production capacity was reduced (P < 0.001). The changes in microbiota composition and predicted functions were significantly associated with body weight loss (P < 0.05). Baseline gut microbiota features were able to explain similar to 25% of variation in total body fat change (post-pre-LED). Conclusions: The gut microbiota and individual taxa were significantly influenced by the LED intervention and correlated with changes in total body fat and body weight in individuals with overweight and pre-diabetes. Despite inter-individual variation, the baseline gut microbiota was a strong predictor of total body fat change during the energy restriction period.","2022-05-23","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-06-30 17:01:58","","","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the biogeographic patterns and ecological processes that structure them remain poorly understood, especially in the oligotrophic ocean. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA genes to investigate the distribution patterns of bacterial and microeukaryotic communities and their assembly mechanisms in the surface waters of the tropical North Pacific Ocean. The fact that both the bacterial and the microeukaryotic communities showed similar distribution patterns (i.e., similar distance-decay patterns) and were clustered according to their geographic origin (i.e., the western tropical North Pacific and central tropical North Pacific) suggested that there was a significant biogeographic pattern of microbiota in the North Pacific Ocean. Indices of alpha diversity such as species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and the Shannon diversity index also differed significantly between regions. The correlations were generally similar between spatial and environmental variables and the alpha and beta diversities of bacteria and microeukaryotes across the entire region. The relative importance of ecological processes differed between bacteria and microeukaryotes: ecological drift was the principal mechanism that accounted for the structure of bacterial communities; heterogeneous selection, dispersal limitation, and ecological drift collectively explained much of the turnover of the microeukaryote communities. IMPORTANCE Bacteria and microeukaryotes are extremely diverse groups in the ocean, where they regulate elemental cycling and energy flow. Studies of marine microbial ecology have benefited greatly from the rapid progress that has been made in genomic sequencing and theoretical microbial ecology. However, the spatial distribution of marine bacteria and microeukaryotes and the nature of the assembly mechanisms that determine their distribution patterns in oligotrophic marine waters are poorly understood. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing methods to identify the distribution patterns and ecological processes of bacteria and microeukaryotes in an oligotrophic, tropical ocean. Our study showed that contrasting community assembly mechanisms underlaid similar biogeographic patterns of surface bacterial and microeukaryotic communities in the tropical North Pacific Ocean.","2022-02","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-06-30 17:05:36","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have started a registry to determine the burden, phenotype, risk factors, disease course and outcomes of IBD in Zimbabwe. Methods and analysis A prospective observational registry with a nested case-control study has been established at a tertiary hospital in Harare, Zimbabwe. The registry is recruiting confirmed IBD cases from the hospital, and other facilities throughout Zimbabwe. Demographic and clinical data are obtained at baseline, 6 months and annually. Two age and sex-matched non-IBD controls per case are recruited-a sibling or second-degree relative, and a randomly selected individual from the same neighbourhood. Cases and controls are interviewed for potential risk factors of IBD, and dietary intake using a food frequency questionnaire. Stool is collected for 16S rRNA-based microbiota profiling, and along with germline DNA from peripheral blood, is being biobanked. The estimated sample size is 86 cases and 172 controls, and the overall registry is anticipated to run for at least 5 years. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographic and phenotypic characteristics of IBD, and incidence and prevalence will be estimated for Harare. Risk factors for IBD will be analysed using conditional logistic regression. For microbial analysis, alpha diversity and beta diversity will be compared between cases and controls, and between IBD phenotypes. Mann-Whitney U tests for alpha diversity and Adonis (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) for beta diversity will be computed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Parirenyatwa Hospital's and University of Zimbabwe's research ethics committee and the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe. Findings will be discussed with patients, and the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health. Results will be presented at scientific meetings, published in peer reviewed journals, and on social media.","2020","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-06-30 17:02:16","","","","12","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Fifty-three healthy volunteers from Mayo Clinic and 50 cohort members from Bangladesh provided oral samples. One aliquot of the OMNIgene ORAL and Scope mouthwash were frozen immediately and one aliquot of the Scope mouthwash remained at ambient temperature for 4 days and was then frozen. DNA was extracted and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was PCR amplified and sequenced using the HiSeq. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Results: The overall stability of the Scope mouthwash samples was relatively high for alpha and beta diversity. For example, the meta-analyzed ICC for the Shannon index was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.96). Similarly, the ICCs for the relative abundance of the top 25 genera were generally high. The comparability of the two sample types was relatively low when measured using ICCs, but were increased by using a Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) to compare the rank order of individuals. Conclusions: Overall, the Scope mouthwash samples appear to be stable at ambient temperature, which suggests that oral rinse samples received by the mail can be used for microbial analyses. However, Scope mouthwash samples were distinct compared with OMNIgene ORAL samples.

Conditions outside of these can stress corals and lead to bleaching, disease, and death. However, some corals can survive in marginal or extreme habitats outside of these ranges. To date there is a paucity of knowledge about the role that associated microbes may play in the acclimation of corals to such extreme habitats. Here, we explore differences in the compositional and functional profile of the microbiomes of the scleractinian coral Porites panamensis living both on and off potentially stressful shallow-water hydrothermal vents. The environment near the vents is extreme, with temperatures exceeding 80 degrees C and pH values below 6. Coral microbiomes under stress often exhibit increased diversity, increased abundance of pathogenic bacteria, and functional profiles that shift toward pathways associated with pathogenic taxa. Samples from along a transect that crossed an arc of hydrothermal vents were sequenced for the 16S rRNA gene (V4 region). On-vent coral microbiomes were distinct from those of off-vent corals, but did not have increased alpha or beta diversity. On-vent samples had a higher relative abundance of the beneficial endosymbiont, Endozoicomonas. On- and off-vent microbiomes did not differ in overall abundance of the endolithic green alga Ostreobium, however, a single ASV, close to O. quekettii was more abundant in on-vent corals. Ostreobium can provide many of the same benefits to corals as zooxanthellae and their symbiosis is better maintained under thermal stress. Surprisingly, on-vent coral microbiomes had fewer microbial taxa that are known to be pathogenic or associated with stress than did off-vent corals. The predicted functional profiles of on-vent microbiomes revealed enrichment of pathways related to aerobic respiration, fermentation and amino acid biosynthesis, but not of virulence-related pathways. Our results suggest that P. panamensis microbiomes have acclimated to the extreme environment of the hydrothermal vent habitat rather than showing signs of stress. These results exemplify the need to focus efforts on examining the mechanisms of resilience, including symbioses with microbiota, in corals living in extreme environments in an effort to design better management strategies for reef-building corals under thermal and pH stress.</p>","2021-09-15","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 17:03:32","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-coral","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

MethodsThis is a sub study of P4 (Postpartum Physiology, Psychology, and Paediatrics Study) and includes 18 mother-infant pairs: 10 NP and 8 HP (HP as defined by blood pressure > 140/90mmHg; of which 6 had PE, and 2 GH), six months postpartum. The participating mothers collected stool samples from themselves and their infants. 16S rRNA V3-V4 amplicons were used to study the faecal microbiome. ResultsThe sample of women and their infants were mostly primiparous (n =16) with vaginal birth (n = 14). At the time of faecal sampling 8 women were using hormonal contraception, and one HP woman remained on an antihypertensive. All women had blood pressure < 130/80mmHg, and 10 had high BMI (> 30). All infants had started solids, 8 were exclusively breastfed, 1 exclusively formula fed and 9 both. Three infants had been exposed to a course of antibiotics. Six months postpartum, there were no significant differences in alpha or beta diversity between the gut microbiota of HP and NP women (P > 0.05). However, a statistically significant difference was detected in alpha diversity between infants following HP and NP, with lower diversity levels in HP infants (P < 0.05). It was also found that at a genus and species level, the gut microbiota of HP women was enriched with Bifidobacterium and Bifididobacterium sp. and depleted in Barnisiella and Barnesiella intestinihominis when compared to NP women (P < 0.05). Similarly, the gut microbiota of infants born from HP was enriched in Streptococcus infantis and depleted in Sutterella, Sutterella sp., Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium aldenense compared to infants born from NP (P < 0.05). DiscussionWhile our findings are at best preliminary, due to the very small sample size, they do suggest that the presence of hypertension in pregnancy may adversely affect the maternal microbiota postpartum, and that of their infants. Further analysis of postpartum microbiome data from future studies will be important to validate these early findings and provide further evidence about the changes in the microbiota in the offspring of women following hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including possible links to the causes of long-term cardiovascular disease, the prevalence of which is increased in women who have experienced HDP.","2022-01-31","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 17:04:47","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Raw grape marc can be hazardous to the environment due to its low pH and high polyphenol content, but previous work has shown that grape marc can be stabilized via vermicomposting to produce organic fertilizer. Here, we utilize 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to characterize the bacterial community composition, diversity and metabolic function during vermicomposting of the white grape marc Vitis vinifera v.

Large, significant changes in the bacterial community composition of grape marc vermicompost were observed by day 7 of vermicomposting and throughout the duration of the experiment until day 91. Similarly, taxonomic and phylogenetic a-diversity increased throughout the experiment and estimates of beta-diversity differed significantly between time points. Functional diversity also changed during vermicomposting, including increases in cellulose metabolism, plant hormone synthesis, and antibiotic synthesis. Thus, vermicomposting of white grape marc resulted in a rich, stable bacterial community with functional properties that may aid plant growth. These results support the use of grape marc vermicompost for sustainable agricultural practices in the wine industry.","2019-05-16","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-06-30 16:59:18","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about soil microbial communities at the treeline, where changes in vegetation in response to global warming are anticipated. Barcoded pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate the bacterial communities of coniferous forest and grassland soils at the treeline of four different peaks above 3,000 m a.s.l. Although the forest soils were more acidic than the grassland soils, the other soil properties were highly variable with no consistent pattern in C and N contents and microbial biomass between two vegetation types. The Acidobacteria and alpha-Proteobacteria were the most abundant phylogenetic groups, although their relative abundances differed among the forest and grassland soil communities and between sites. The composition of bacterial communities or beta-diversity, varied significantly between the sites and vegetation types. In contrast, alpha-diversity only differed significantly between sites. Two of the grassland sites and one forest had converted from forests and grassland, respectively within the last 60 years. The abundances of some genera, such as Acidobacteria Gp2 in the grasslands converted from forests, more closely resembled those of the other forest sites than the historically grassland sites, while the abundance of Acidobacteria Gp1 in the forest converted from grassland was more similar to the historically grassland sites. These results suggest a legacy effect for the transition of forest to grassland. Bacterial community structure also correlated significantly with soil pH, organic C and C/N. These results suggest that the present vegetation at the treeline influences soil bacterial community structure, although there is also a significant legacy effect on the abundance of certain bacterial groups.","2021-06","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-06-29 17:18:18","","","","","201","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-geography; var-temperature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods 10 subjects with SS, 14 subjects with DES and 12 controls were enrolled. Corneal staining, tear break up time (TBUT) and tear secretion were evaluated. Bacterial genomic 16s rRNA from stool samples were analyzed. Main outcomes were microbiome compositional differences among groups and their correlation to dry eye signs. Results Gut microbiome analysis revealed significant compositional differences in SS compared to controls and DES. In phylum, Bacteriodetes increased, while Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Actinobacteria decreased (p<0.05). In genus, Bifidobacterium was reduced (vs controls; p = 0.025, vs DES; p = 0.026). Beta diversity of SS also showed significant distances from controls and DES (p = 0.007 and 0.019, respectively).

Unfortunately, the collection of these samples involves relatively invasive procedures and is resource-demanding, limiting its regular use. Non-invasive samples from the upper airways could constitute an interesting alternative, but its relationship with COPD is still underexplored. We examined the merits of saliva to identify the typical profile of COPD oral bacteria and test its association with the disease. Methods Outpatients with COPD and age-sex matched healthy controls were recruited and characterised based on clinical parameters and 16S rRNA profiling of oral bacteria. A clustering analysis based on patients' oral bacteria beta-diversity and logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the association between oral bacteria composition and COPD. Results 128 individuals participated (70 patients and 58 controls). Differential abundance analyses showed differences in patients comparable to the ones previously observed in samples from the lower respiratory tract, i.e., an increase in Proteobacteria (particularly Haemophilus) and loss of microbiota diversity. An unsupervised clustering analysis separated patients in two groups based on microbiota composition differing significantly in the frequency of patients hospitalized due to severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) and in the frequency of GOLD D patients. Furthermore, a low frequency of Prevotella was associated with a significantly higher risk of recent severe AECOPD and of being GOLD D. Conclusion Salivary bacteria showed an association with COPD, particularly with severe exacerbations, supporting the use of this non-invasive specimen for future studies of heterogeneous respiratory diseases like COPD.","2022-01-29","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 18:04:45","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the effect of supplementing a high-fat diet (HFD) with kale (HFKV) in C57BL/6J mice. We particularly explored its role in metabolic parameters, gut bacterial composition and diversity using 16S rRNA sequencing, systematically compared changes under each phylum and predicted the functional potential of the altered bacterial community using PICRUSt2. Like other cruciferous vegetables, kale attenuated HFD-induced inflammation. In addition, kale modulated HFD-induced changes in cecal microbiota composition. The HFD lowered bacterial diversity, increased the Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and altered composition. Specifically, it lowered Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Bacteroidia, Rikenellaceae and Prevotellaceae) but increased Firmicutes (mainly class Bacilli). Kale supplementation lowered the F/B ratio, increased both alpha and beta diversity and reduced class Bacilli and Erysipelotrichi but had no effect on Clostridia. Within Actinobacteria, HFKV particularly increased Coriobacteriales/Coriobacteriaceae about four-fold compared to the HFD (p < 0.05). Among Bacteroidia, HFKV increased the species Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron by over two-fold (p = 0.05) compared to the HFD. This species produces plant polysaccharide digesting enzymes. Compared to the HFD, kale supplementation enhanced several bacterial metabolic functions, including glycan degradation, thiamine metabolism and xenobiotic metabolism. Our findings provide evidence that kale is a functional food that modulates the microbiota and changes in inflammation phenotype.","2021-02","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 17:13:57","","","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-rodent gut; var-adiposity; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, studies undertaking a comprehensive approach to consider host-microbial metabolic relationships remain scarce. Metabolomic analysis yielding detailed information regarding metabolites found in a given biological compartment holds promise for such an approach. This work aimed to explore the associations between host plasma metabolomic signatures and gut microbiota composition in healthy adults of the Milieu Interieur study. For 846 subjects, gut microbiota composition was profiled through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in stools. Metabolomic signatures were generated through proton NMR analysis of plasma. The associations between metabolomic variables and alpha- and beta-diversity indexes and relative taxa abundances were tested using multi-adjusted partial Spearman correlations, permutational ANOVA and multivariate associations with linear models, respectively. A multiple testing correction was applied (Benjamini-Hochberg, 10 % false discovery rate). Microbial richness was negatively associated with lipid-related signals and positively associated with amino acids, choline, creatinine, glucose and citrate (-0 center dot 133 <= Spearman's rho <= 0 center dot 126). Specific associations between metabolomic signals and abundances of taxa were detected (twenty-five at the genus level and nineteen at the species level): notably, numerous associations were observed for creatinine (positively associated with eleven species and negatively associated with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii). This large-scale population-based study highlights metabolites associated with gut microbial features and provides new insights into the understanding of complex host-gut microbiota metabolic relationships. In particular, our results support the implication of a `gut-kidney axis'.

The results demonstrated that dietary Bacillus (25 mg/kg) increased average final weight, average daily gain (ADG), and decreased the malonaldehyde (MDA) in birds (P < 0.05). Dietary Bacillus (25 mg/kg) and NSPases + Bacillus (150 mg/kg + 25 mg/kg) presented much higher glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in birds (P < 0.05). Additionally, as revealed by beta-diversity indices and analysis of similarities, dietary NSPases + Bacillus could affect the ileum microbial abundances and diversities at the genera level (P < 0.05), but it had no effect on the caecal microbiota. Also, 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that dietary Bacillus and NSPases + Bacillus increased the populations of Ruminococcaceae genera in the cecum (P < 0.05), and S24-7_group and Lactobacillus genera in the ileum (P < 0.05). However, dietary NSPases and Bacillus alone and in combination could significantly decrease the content of Bacteroides in the ileum (P < 0.05). According to Spearman correlation analysis, 7 ilea bacterial microbiomes (S24-7 group, Lactobacillus, Subgroup 2, Subgroup 1, Kitasatospora, Candidatus Solibacter, and Akkermansia) were positively correlated with SOD (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Bacillus (25 mg/kg) and NSPases (150 mg/kg) included in the diet could efficiently enhance the growth performance by altered gut microbiota composition at the genera level and antioxidant indices of ducks.","2021-12-08","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 15:04:43","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-duck gut; var-growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the increasing interest in edaphic factors that drive bacterial community composition in Antarctic rocky communities, few researchers focused attention on the direct effects of sun exposure on bacterial diversity; we herein reported significant differences in the northern and southern communities. The analysis of beta-diversity showed significant differences among sampled localities. For instance, the most abundant genera found in the north-exposed rocks were Rhodococcus and Blastococcus in Knobhead Mt.; Ktedonobacter and Cyanobacteria Family I Group I in Finger Mt.; Rhodococcus and Endobacter in University Valley; and Segetibacter and Tetrasphaera in Siegfried Peak samples. In south-exposed rocks, instead, the most abundant genera were Escherichia/Shigella and Streptococcus in Knobhead Mt.; Ktedonobacter and Rhodococcus in Finger Mt.; Ktedonobacter and Roseomonas in University Valley; and Blastocatella, Cyanobacteria Family I Group I and Segetibacter in Siegfried Peak. Significant biomarkers, detected by the Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size, were also found among north- and south-exposed communities. Besides, the large number of positive significant co-occurrences may suggest a crucial role of positive associations over competitions under the harsher conditions where these rock-inhabiting microorganisms spread. Although the effect of geographic distances in these extreme environments play a significant role in shaping biodiversity, the study of an edaphic factor, such as solar exposure, adds an important contribution to the mosaic of microbial biodiversity of Antarctic bacterial cryptoendolithic communities.","2022-02","2022-06-27 16:29:12","2022-07-19 19:50:18","","328-339","","2","83","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The gut microbiota is important for host health and provides new insight into endangered species conservation. Forest musk deer (FMD) and alpine musk deer (AMD) are typical small ruminants, globally endangered due to excessive hunting and habitat loss. Although nearly 60 years of captive musk deer breeding has reduced the hunting pressure in the wild, fatal gastrointestinal diseases restrict the growth of captive populations. In this study, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing revealed the differences in gut microbiota between FMD and AMD based on 166 fecal samples. The alpha diversity was higher in FMD than in AMD, probably helping FMD adapt to different and wider habitats. The beta-diversity was higher between adult FMD and AMD than juveniles and in winter than late spring. The phylum Firmicutes and the genera Christensenellaceae R7 group, Ruminococcus, Prevotellaceae UCG-004, and Monoglobus were significantly higher in abundance in FMD than in AMD. However, the phylum Bacteroidetes and genera Bacteroides, UCG-005, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, and Alistipes were significantly higher in AMD than FMD. The expression of metabolic functions was higher in AMD than in FMD, a beneficial pattern for AMD to maintain higher energy and substance metabolism. Captive AMD may be at higher risk of intestinal diseases than FMD, with higher relative abundances of most opportunistic pathogens and the expression of disease-related functions. These results provide valuable data for breeding healthy captive musk deer and assessing their adaptability in the wild.","2022-02","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-07-19 15:16:18","","1325-1339","","3","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-deer gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), a pregnancy outcome with serious short- and long-term consequences. occurs more frequently in black and in obese women in the United States. Objectives: In a prospective, case-control sample matched for race and obesity (cases = 16, controls = 32). we compared the fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. We hypothesized that a Western diet would be associated with reduced microbiota richness and a metabolic signature predicting incidence of SPTB. Methods: The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S-tagged sequencing and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze both plasma and fecal metabolites. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for the comparison of microbiota genera, a-diversity, fecal and plasma metabolites, and dietary variables between term and SPTB. beta-Diversity was analyzed using permutational multivariate ANOVA, and metabolite associations were assessed by module analysis. Results: A decrease in a-diversity was strongly associated with the development of SPTB, especially in the taxonomic class of Betaproteobacteria. Of 824 fecal metabolites, 22 metabolites (mostly lipids) differed between cases and controls (P < 0.01), with greater DHA (22:6n-3) and EPA (20:5n-3) in cases [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2]. The most significant fecal metabolite module (FDR-adjusted P = 0.008) was dominated by DHA and EPA. Dietary saturated fat (primarily palmitate) intake was greater in cases (31.38 +/- 7.37 compared with 26.08 +/- 8.62 g, P = 0.045) and was positively correlated with fecal DHA and EPA (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Reduced alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota and higher excretion of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in stool may provide a novel biomarker signature predicting SPTB in women with a low-fiber, high-fat diet.

Obesity is a global epidemic in the industrialized and developing world, and many children suffer from obesity-related complications. Gut microbiota dysbiosis might have significant effect on the development of obesity. The microbiota continues to develop through childhood and thus childhood may be the prime time for microbiota interventions to realize health promotion or disease prevention. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure and function of pediatric gut microbiota. Methods. According to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, twenty-three normal weight and twenty-eight obese children were recruited from Nanjing, China. Genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR, and sequencing was applied to analyze the gut microbiota diversity and composition using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Results. The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed a decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota with increasing body weight. The alpha diversity indices showed that the normal weight group had higher abundance and observed species than the obese group (Chao1: P < 0.001; observed species: P < 0.001; PD whole tree: P < 0.001; Shannon index: P = 0.008). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed significant differences in gut microbial community structure between the normal weight group and the obese group. The liner discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that fifty-five species of bacteria were abundant in the fecal samples of the normal weight group and forty-five species of bacteria were abundant in the obese group. In regard to phyla, the gut microbiota in the obese group had lower proportions of Bacteroidetes (51.35%) compared to the normal weight group (55.48%) (P = 0.030). There was no statistical difference in Firmicutes between the two groups (P = 0.436), and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes between the two groups had no statistical difference (P = 0.983). At the genus level, Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospira, Megamonas, and Haemophilus were significantly more abundant in the obese group than in the normal weight group (P = 0.048, P = 0.018, P < 0.001, P = 0.040, and P = 0.003, respectively). The fecal microbiota of children in the obese group had lower proportions of Oscillospira and Dialister compared to the normal weight group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.002, respectively). Conclusions. Our results showed a decrease in gut microbiota abundance and diversity as the BMI increased. Variations in the bacterial community structure were associated with obesity. Gut microbiota dysbiosis might play a crucial part in the development of obesity in Chinese children.","2020-01-14","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-07-19 15:10:11","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human gut; var-adiposity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A case-controlled study with sixteen NASH and eight control subjects was done. We performed DNA extraction from stool samples and bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing using MiSeq (TM). The sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology software. We calculated relative abundances, determined alpha diversity, obtained beta diversity by principal coordinate analysis, and conducted the partial least-squares regression model. Results. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes tended to be higher in NASH group. The Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes (B/F) ratio was significantly elevated in NASH patients. The pattern of gut microbiota in NASH was clearly separated from that of control subjects. Factors influencing the separation of NASH from control subjects were age, diabetes, body mass index, Bacteroidetes phylum, metformin, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Thermotogae, and Caldithrix and Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio.

Zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) shared by both groups accounted for about 50% of all zOTUs present. Still, the large individual variability in the blow microbiota resulted in a small number of core taxa (defined as present in at least 60% of whales).

Gut microbes represent the initial site for toxicant processing following dietary exposures to environmental contaminants. The diet is the primary route of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are absorbed via the gut, and subsequently interfere with neurodevelopment and behavior. Developmental exposures to PCBs have been linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which are also associated with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) distress and intestinal dysbiosis. We hypothesized that developmental PCB exposure impacts colonization of the gut microbiota, resulting in GI pathophysiology, in a genetically susceptible host. Mouse dams expressing two heritable human mutations (double mutants [DM]) that result in abnormal Ca2+ dynamics and produce behavioral deficits (gain of function mutation in the ryanodine receptor 1 [T48261-RYR1] and a human CGG repeat expansion [170-200 CGG repeats] in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 [FMR1 premutation]). DM and congenic wild type (WT) controls were exposed to PCBs (0-6 mg/kg/d) in the diet starting 2 weeks before gestation and continuing through postnatal day 21 (P21). Intestinal physiology (Ussing chambers), inflammation (qPCR) and gut microbiome (16S sequencing) studies were performed in offspring mice (P28-P30). Developmental exposure to PCBs in the maternal diet caused significant mucosal barrier defects in ileum and colon (increased secretory state and tight junction permeability) of juvenile DM mice. Furthermore, PCB exposure increased the intestinal inflammatory profile (Il6, Il1 beta, and Il22), and resulted in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, including altered beta-diversity, in juvenile DM mice developmentally exposed to 1 mg/kg/d PCBs when compared to WT controls. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a novel interaction between PCB exposure and the gut microbiota in a genetically susceptible host that provide novel insight into environmental risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.

Distinct microbial signatures were noted for FA to different foods. Prevotella copri (P. copri) was the most overrepresented species in non-allergic controls. SCFAs levels were significantly higher in the non-allergic compared to the FA groups, whereas P. copri significantly correlated with all three SCFAs. We used these microbial differences to distinguish between FA patients and non-allergic healthy controls with an area under the curve of 0.90, and for the classification of FA patients according to their FA types using a supervised learning algorithm. Bacteroides and P. copri were identified as taxa potentially contributing to KEGG acetate-related pathways enriched in non-allergic compared to FA.

Plant growth responses to some biostimulants and poorly soluble fertilizers could increase soil microbial diversity and provide greater plant access to less soluble nutrients. We assessed an agricultural soil amended with a multispecies microbial biostimulant in comparison with two fertilizers that differed in elemental solubilities to identify effects on soil bacterial communities associated with two annual pasture species (subterranean clover and Wimmera ryegrass). The treatments applied were: a multispecies microbial biostimulant, a poorly soluble rock mineral fertilizer at a rate of 5.6 kg P ha(-1), a chemical fertilizer at a rate of 5.6 kg P ha(-1), and a negative control with no fertilizer or microbial biostimulant. The two annual pasture species were grown separately for 10 weeks in a glasshouse with soil maintained at 70% of field capacity. Soil bacteria were studied using 16S rRNA with 27F and 519R bacterial primers on the Mi-seq platform. The microbial biostimulant had no effect on growth of either of the pasture species. However, it did influence soil biodiversity in a way that was dependent on the plant species. While application of the fertilizers increased plant growth, they were both associated with the lowest diversity of the soil bacterial community based on Fisher and Inverse Simpson indices. Additionally, these responses were plant-dependent; soil bacterial richness was highly correlated with soil pH for subterranean clover but not for Wimmera ryegrass. Soil bacterial richness was lowest following application of each fertilizer when subterranean clover was grown. In contrast, for Wimmera ryegrass, soil bacterial richness was lowest for the control and rock mineral fertilizer. Beta diversity at the bacterial OTU level of resolution by permanova demonstrated a significant impact of soil amendments, plant species and an interaction between plant type and soil amendments. This experiment highlights the complexity of how soil amendments, including microbial biostimulants, may influence soil bacterial communities associated with different plant species, and shows that caution is required when linking soil biodiversity to plant growth. In this case, the microbial biostimulant influenced soil biodiversity without influencing plant growth.","2021-02-04","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-06-30 19:27:51","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although local habitat quality drives macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance, little is known about their microbiota. In most animals, the microbiota provides benefits, such as increasing the rate at which nutrients are metabolized, facilitating immune system development, and defending against pathogenic attack. Our objectives were to identify the bacteria within aquatic invertebrates and determine whether their composition varied with taxonomy, habitat, diet, and time of sample collection. In 2016 and 2017, we collected 264 aquatic invertebrates from the mainstem Saint John (Wolastoq) River in New Brunswick, Canada, representing 15 orders. We then amplified the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene within each individual, which revealed nearly 20,000 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The microbiota across all aquatic invertebrates were dominated by Proteobacteria (69.25% of the total sequence reads), but they differed significantly in beta diversity, both among host invertebrate taxa (genus-, family-, and order-levels) and temporally. In contrast to previous work, we observed no microbiota differences among functional feeding groups or traditional feeding habits, and neither water velocity nor microhabitat type structured microbiota variability. Our findings suggest that host invertebrate taxonomy was the most important factor in modulating the composition of the microbiota, likely through a combination of vertical and horizontal bacterial transmission, and evolutionary processes. This is one of the most comprehensive studies of freshwater invertebrate microbiota to date, and it underscores the need for future studies of invertebrate microbiota evolution and linkages to environmental bacteria and physico-chemical conditions.","2020-12","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-07-18 22:11:07","","14000-14019","","24","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-invertebrate blood","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the faecal microbiota of horses was investigated to determine how quickly the bacterial communities respond and stabilise following sudden diet change. Six Thoroughbred mares were stabled for six weeks, consuming freshly cut pasture (on weeks 1, 3 and 5), before being abruptly fed three conserved forage-based diets (weeks 2, 4 and 6). The conserved forage-based diets were a chopped ensiled forage fed exclusively or with whole oats, and perennial ryegrass hay fed with whole oats. Faecal samples were collected at regular intervals from each horse following each diet change. High throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to evaluate the faecal microbiota. There were significant differences in the diversity of the microbiota (p < 0.001), with clustering of samples observed by diet group. A stable faecal microbiota profile was observed in the samples from 96 h after consumption of the treatment diets containing ensiled chopped forage. The present study confirmed that the diversity and community structure of the faecal bacteria in horses is diet-specific and resilient following dietary transition and emphasised the need for modern horse feeding management to incorporate large proportions of forage into diets. The management of competition horses in New Zealand often involves rotations of short periods of stall confinement and concentrate feeding, with periods of time at pasture. Under these systems, horses may undergo abrupt dietary changes, with the incorporation of grains or concentrate feeds to the diet to meet performance needs, or sudden changes in the type of forage fed in response to a lack of fresh or conserved forage. Abrupt changes in dietary management are a risk factor for gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, potentially due to the negative effects observed on the population of GI microbiota. In the present study, the faecal microbiota of horses was investigated to determine how quickly the bacterial communities; (1) responded to dietary change, and (2) stabilised following abrupt dietary transition. Six Thoroughbred mares were stabled for six weeks, consuming freshly cut pasture (weeks 1, 3 and 5), before being abruptly transitioned to conserved forage-based diets, both offered ad libitum. Intestinal markers were administered to measure digesta transit time immediately before each diet change. The conserved forage-based diets were fed according to a 3 x 3 Latin square design (weeks 2, 4 and 6), and comprised a chopped ensiled forage fed exclusively (Diet FE) or with whole oats (Diet FE + O), and perennial ryegrass hay fed with whole oats (Diet H + O). Faecal samples were collected at regular intervals from each horse following the diet changes. High throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to evaluate the faecal microbiota. There were significant differences in alpha diversity across diets (p < 0.001), and a significant effect of diet on the beta diversity (ANOSIM, p = 0.001), with clustering of samples observed by diet group. There were differences in the bacterial phyla across diets (p < 0.003), with the highest relative abundances observed for Firmicutes (62-64%) in the two diets containing chopped ensiled forage, Bacteroidetes (32-38%) in the pasture diets, and Spirochaetes (17%) in the diet containing hay. Major changes in relative abundances of faecal bacteria appeared to correspond with the cumulative percentage of intestinal markers retrieved in the faeces as the increasing amounts of digesta from each new diet transited the animals. A stable faecal microbiota profile was observed in the samples from 96 h after abrupt transition to the treatment diets containing ensiled chopped forage. The present study confirmed that the diversity and community structure of the faecal bacteria in horses is diet-specific and resilient following dietary transition and emphasised the need to have modern horse feeding management that reflects the ecological niche, particularly by incorporating large proportions of forage into equine diets.","2021-09","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-06-29 17:05:03","","","","9","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-horse gut; var-diet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, results from human studies remain scarce and conflicting. We wanted to elucidate the multivariable-adjusted association between gut metagenome and BP in a large, representative, well-phenotyped population sample. We performed a focused analysis to examine the previously reported inverse associations between sodium intake and Lactobacillus abundance and between Lactobacillus abundance and BP. Methods and Results We studied a population sample of 6953 Finns aged 25 to 74 years (mean age, 49.212.9 years; 54.9% women). The participants underwent a health examination, which included BP measurement, stool collection, and 24-hour urine sampling (N=829). Gut microbiota was analyzed using shallow shotgun metagenome sequencing. In age- and sex-adjusted models, the alpha (within-sample) and beta (between-sample) diversities of taxonomic composition were strongly related to BP indexes (P<0.001 for most). In multivariable-adjusted models, <beta> diversity was only associated with diastolic BP (P=0.032). However, we observed significant, mainly positive, associations between BP indexes and 45 microbial genera (P<0.05), of which 27 belong to the phylum Firmicutes. Interestingly, we found mostly negative associations between 19 distinct Lactobacillus species and BP indexes (P<0.05). Of these, greater abundance of the known probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei was associated with lower mean arterial pressure and lower dietary sodium intake (P<0.001 for both). Conclusions Although the associations between overall gut taxonomic composition and BP are weak, individuals with hypertension demonstrate changes in several genera. We demonstrate strong negative associations of certain Lactobacillus species with sodium intake and BP, highlighting the need for experimental studies.","2020-08-04","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-06-30 19:31:22","","","","15","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-diet; var-medical condition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in PSC was reported in several studies, but the microbiological features of the salivary microbiota in PSC have not been established. Here we compared the salivary microbial communities of 24 pediatric-onset PSC patients, 16 age-matched ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 24 healthy controls (HCs) by analyzing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence data. The species-richness (alpha-diversity) showed no significant between-group differences, whereas the overall salivary microbiota structure (beta-diversity) showed significant differences among the three groups. Taxonomic assignment revealed that the PSC salivary microbiota were characterized by significant decreases in the abundance of Rothia and Haemophilus compared to the HC group, and significantly decreased Haemophilus and increased Oribacterium compared to the UC group. By combining the genera selected by the random forest algorithm in machine learning, followed by confirmation with 10-fold cross-validation, we were able to distinguish the PSC group from the HC group with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7423, and from the UC group with the AUC of 0.8756.

Therefore, we collected 39 soil samples from a riparian oasis zone (ROZ) to the circumjacent desert zone (CDZ) at the lower reaches of Heihe River to evaluate bacterial communities based on the 16S rRNA gene data. We found that the bacterial community composition differed between ROZ and CDZ habitats, with significantly higher relative abundance of the phyla Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria in ROZ, whereas the abundance of the phyla Actinobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus was greater in CDZ. The difference in the bacterial community was almost entirely generated by the species turnover rather than the nestedness among all samples. In addition, we found that bacterial alpha-diversity index showed no significant difference between ROZ and CDZ habitats. The distance-decay analysis showed that spatial distance, plant community, soil property, and plant functional trait were correlated with bacterial community variations. However, the variation partition analysis (VPA) revealed that both soil properties and plant community strongly explained the difference [such as soil water content (WC), soil silt content, and plant community structure] compared with plant functional traits in bacterial beta-diversity and species turnover. Based on a co-occurrence network analysis, we found that the bacterial network of ROZ, which had more negative correlations, higher average connectivity, shorter average path length, and smaller modularity, was more complex than the network of CDZ. This suggested that the bacterial community was more stable and less vulnerable to change in the ROZ habitat than in the CDZ habitat. Overall, our findings suggest that the heterogeneity of soil properties and plant community collectively affect the structure of the soil bacterial community in an arid inland river basin. However, the influence of plant functional traits on the variation of the bacterial community depends on soil properties and plant community.","2019-11-26","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-06-30 19:05:14","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the main metabolic steps of bilirubin metabolism, including the formation of stercobilin and urobilin, take place in the human gastrointestinal tract, potential interactions with the human gut microbiota are unexplored. This study investigated, whether gut microbiota composition is altered in Gilbert's Syndrome (GS), a mild form of chronically elevated serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) compared to matched controls. Potential differences in the incidence of CRC-associated bacterial species in GS were also assessed. To this end, a secondary investigation of the BILIHEALTH study was performed, assessing 45 adults with elevated UCB levels (GS) against 45 age- and sex-matched controls (C). Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No association between mildly increased UCB and the composition of the gut microbiota in this healthy cohort was found. The alpha and beta diversity did not differ between C and GS and both groups showed a typical representation of the known dominant phyla. Furthermore, no difference in abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which have been associated with the mucosa of CRC patients were observed between the groups. A sequence related to the Christensenella minuta strain YIT 12065 was identified with a weak association value of 0.521 as an indicator species in the GS group. This strain has been previously associated with a lower body mass index, which is typical for the GS phenotype. Overall, sex was the only driver for an identifiable difference in the study groups, as demonstrated by a greater bacterial diversity in women. After adjusting for confounding factors and multiple testing, we can conclude that the GS phenotype does not affect the composition of the human gut microbiota in this generally healthy study group.","2021-09-16","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-07-19 17:51:26","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants completed a food record for 3 d before the stool collection. Colonic transit was measured with scintigraphy. Key Results: The constipated patients were older (48 +/- 15 vs 39 +/- 10 y, P=. 02) than healthy participants but had a similar BMI. The total daily caloric intake was less (P=. 005) in constipated (1265 +/- 350 kcal) than healthy participants (1597 +/- 402 kcal). Fourteen patients but only two controls (P<. 005), had delayed colonic transit. For most measures of alpha (eg, Observed OTU number, Shannon index) and beta diversity (eg, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, UniFrac, phyla level abundance), the ICCs between two stool samples were high, indicating moderate or strong agreement, and similar in healthy people and constipated patients. The ICC for the weighted UniFrac distance, which is weighted by abundance, was lower than its unweighted counterpart, indicating that the unweighted measure is more robust and reproducible. Conclusions and Inferences: The intraindividual reproducibility of fecal microbiota in constipated patients is high and comparable to healthy participants. For most purposes, evaluating the fecal microbiota in a single stool sample should generally suffice in adequately powered studies of healthy and constipated patients.","2017-10","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-06-30 19:37:28","","","","10","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its development is ascribed to several factors, including genetic predisposition and dietary management, and recent evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota may be involved as well. Previous works have shown obesity to be linked to significant changes in gut microbiota composition in humans and mice, but only limited information is available on the role played by canine gut microbiota. The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate whether composition of canine faecal microbiota may be influenced by overweight condition and breed. All the enrolled companion dogs were young adults, intact, healthy, and fed commercial extruded pet food; none had received antibiotics, probiotics or immunosuppressant drugs in the previous six months. Labrador Retriever (LR) and Border Collie (BC) were chosen as reference breeds and Body Condition Score (BCS) on a 9-point scale as reference method for evaluating body fat. The faecal microbial communities of 15 lean (BCS 4-5/9; 7 LRs and 8 BCs) and 14 overweight (BCS > 5/9; 8 LRs and 6 BCs) family dogs were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Moreover, for each dog, the daily intake of energy (kcal/d) and dietary macronutrients (g/d) were calculated according to an accurate feeding history collection. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes resulted the predominant phyla (51.5 +/- 10.0% and 33.4 +/- 8.5%, respectively) in all dogs. Bioinformatic and statistical analysis revealed that no bacterial taxon differed significantly based on body condition, except for genus Allisonella (p < 0.05); BC gut microbiota was richer (p < 0.05) in bacteria belonging to phyla Actinobacteria (family Coriobacteriaceae in particular) and Firmicutes (Allobaculum and Roseburia genera). No remarkable differences were recorded either for diversity indices (i.e., alpha diversity, p > 0.10) or for divergence within the sample set (i.e., beta diversity, p > 0.05). PERMANOVA tests performed on single factors demonstrated the tendency of dietary protein to influence the recruited dogs' microbiota beta-diversity at amplicon sequence variant level (p = 0.08). In conclusion, the faecal microbiota of dogs involved in this exploratory study showed no major variations based on body condition. However, our findings suggested that certain bacterial taxa previously acknowledged in obesity-related studies may be detected in dissimilar amounts depending on canine breed.","2022-06-02","2022-06-27 16:29:13","2022-06-30 16:59:40","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Very limited information is available on the composition of the microbial community of hens raised in different housing environments. This study was conducted to determine the effects of CC and enriched colony cages (EC) on cecal microbiota of two commercial laying hen strains, Hy-Line W36 (W36) and Hy-Line Brown (HB) during the late production stage (53, 58, 67, and 72 weeks of age). Cecal microbiota was studied by analyzing 16S rRNA gene sequences with Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) 2 ver. 2018.8. Differentially abundant taxa were identified by Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis (P< 0.05, LDA score > 2.0). At phylum level, Actinobacteria was significantly enriched in W36 at all time points while Synergistetes (53 weeks), Spirochaetes (58 weeks), and Synergistetes and Spirochaetes (67 weeks) were significantly higher in HB. At genus level,Bifidobacterium(at all time points) and butyric acid producing genera such asButyricicoccusandSubdoligranulum(58 and 72 weeks) were significantly higher in W36 as compared to HB. Moreover, Proteobacteria (72 weeks) and its associated genusCampylobacter(67 and 72 weeks) were significantly enriched in EC as compared to CC. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in HB (at all time points) and in EC (67 weeks) as compared to W36 and CC, respectively. Similarly, there was a significant difference in community structure (beta diversity) between W36 and HB (all time points) as well as between EC and CC (67 weeks). The effect of housing and strains was not only seen at the bacterial composition and structure but also reflected at their functional level. Notably, KEGG metabolic pathways predicted to be involved in carbohydrates degradation and amino acids biosynthesis by PICRUSt analysis were significantly different between W36 and HB housed at CC and EC. In sum, cecal microbiota composition, diversities, and their functional pathways were affected by housing type which further varied between two commercial laying hen strains, HB and W36. This suggests that both housing and genetic strains of laying hens should be considered for selection of the alternative housing systems such as enriched colony cage.","2020-06-23","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-30 20:19:05","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut; var-environmental","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fermentation-driven bioactivation of herbal medicines can result in improved therapeutic potencies and efficacies. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet and fructose in water with PR (400 mg/kg) or PR fermented by Bifidobacterium breve (400 mg/kg) for 10 weeks. Histological staining, qPCR, Western blot, and 16s rRNA sequencing were used to determine the protective effects of PR and fermented PR (fPR) against metabolic dysfunction. Results: Treatment with both PR and fPR for 10 weeks resulted in a reduction in body weight gain with a more significant reduction in the latter group. Lactate, important for energy metabolism and homeostasis, was increased during fermentation. Both PR and fPR caused significant down-regulation of the intestinal expression of the MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha genes. However, for the IL-6 and TNF-alpha gene expressions, the inhibitory effect of fPR was more pronounced (p < 0.01) than that of PR (p < 0.05). Oral glucose tolerance test results showed that both PR and fPR treatments improved glucose homeostasis. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the expression of hepatic gene PPAR gamma, a key regulator of lipid and glucose metabolism, following fPR but not PR treatment. Activation of hepatic AMPK phosphorylation was significantly enhanced by both PR and fPR treatment. In addition, both PR and fPR reduced adipocyte size in highly significant manners (p < 0.001). Treatment by fPR but not PR significantly reduced the expression of PPAR gamma and low-density lipoproteins in adipose tissue. Conclusion: Treatment with fPR appears to be more potent than that of PR in improving the pathways related to glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD) + fructose-fed animals. The results revealed that the process of fermentation of PR enhanced lactate and facilitated the enrichment of certain microbial communities that contribute to anti-obesity and anti-inflammatory activities.","2020-02","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-30 18:46:36","","","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; alpha diversity; beta diversity; biome-human gut; biome-rodent model; var-adiposity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal signs (AAGS) occur commonly in cats. Coadministration of synbiotics is associated with decreased AAGS in people, potentially due to stabilization of the fecal microbiome and metabolome. The purpose of this double-blinded randomized-controlled trial was to compare AAGS and the fecal microbiome and metabolome between healthy cats that received clindamycin with a placebo or synbiotic. Methods. 16 healthy domestic shorthair cats from a research colony were randomized to receive 150 mg clindamycin with either a placebo (eight cats) or commercially available synbiotic (eight cats) once daily for 21 days with reevaluation 603 days thereafter. All cats ate the same diet. Food consumption, vomiting, and fecal score were recorded. Fecal samples were collected daily on the last three days of baseline (days 5-7), treatment (26-28), and recovery (631-633). Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed. Clinical signs, alpha and beta diversity metrics, dysbiosis indices, proportions of bacteria groups, and metabolite profiles were compared between treatment groups using repeated measures ANOVAs. Fecal metabolite pathway analysis was performed. P < 0.05 was considered significant. The Benjamini & Hochberg's False Discovery Rate was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results. Median age was six and five years, respectively, for cats in the placebo and synbiotic groups. Hyporexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or some combination therein were induced in all cats. Though vomiting was less in cats receiving a synbiotic, the difference was not statistically significant. Bacterial diversity decreased significantly on days 26-28 in both treatment groups. Decreases in Actinobacteria (Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Slackia), Bacteriodetes (Bacteroides), Lachnospiraceae (Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia), Ruminococcaceae (Faecilobacterium, Ruminococcus), and Erysipelotrichaceae (Bulleidia, [Eubacterium]) and increases in Clostridiaceae (Clostridium) and Proteobacteria (Aeromonadales, Enterobacteriaceae) occurred in both treatment groups, with incomplete normalization by days 631-633. Derangements in short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, indole, sphingolipid, benzoic acid, cinnaminic acid, and polyamine profiles also occurred, some of which persisted through the terminal sampling timepoint and differed between treatment groups. Discussion. Cats administered clindamycin commonly develop AAGS, as well as short- and long-term dysbiosis and alterations in fecal metabolites. Despite a lack of differences in clinical signs between treatment groups, significant differences in their fecal metabolomic profiles were identified. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether antibiotic-induced dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk of future AAGS or metabolic diseases in cats and whether synbiotic administration ameliorates this risk.","2018-07-17","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-07-19 17:11:04","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-antibiotics; var-disease; var-probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite substantial environmental differences, bacterial phyla were represented in similar proportions, with Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria the dominant phyla in all forests except one mangrove forest in Sarawak, although highly significant heterogeneity in frequency of individual phyla was detected among forests. In contrast, species diversity (alpha-diversity) differed to a much greater extent, being nearly six-fold higher in the mangrove forest (Chao' index = 6,862) than in forests in Singapore and Sarawak (similar to 1,250). In addition, natural mixed dipterocarp forests had lower species diversity than acacia and oil palm plantations, indicating that aboveground tree composition does not influence soil bacterial diversity. Shannon and Chaol indices were correlated positively, implying that skewed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) distribution was associated with the abundance of overall and rare (singleton) OTUs. No OTUs were represented in all 28 forests, and forest -specific OTUs accounted for over 70% of all detected OTUs. Forests that were geographically adjacent and/or of the same forest type had similar bacterial species composition, and a positive correlation was detected between species divergence (beta-diversity) and direct distance between forests. Both alpha- and beta-diversities were correlated with soil pH. These results suggest that soil bacterial communities in different forests evolve largely independently of each other and that soil bacterial communities adapt to their local environment, modulated by bacterial dispersal (distance effect) and forest type. Therefore, we conclude that the biogeography of soil bacteria communities described here is non-random, reflecting the influences of contemporary environmental factors and evolutionary history.","2017-02","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-27 16:29:14","","1-20","","1","92","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, changes to the oral microbial composition after gastric H. pylori eradication therapy has not yet been identified. This study aims to dissect whether the oral microbiota is involved and which bacterium mediates the clinic failure in H. pylori eradication. In the present study, the oral microorganisms from patients who had received the gastric H. pylori eradication treatment were analyzed by a high-throughput 16S rRNA deep sequencing. We found that the beta diversity and composition of oral microbiota were remarkably changed in the patients who had experienced successful gastric H. pylori eradication treatment (SE group) compared to the failure group (FE group). Significantly enriched families, including Prevotellaceae, Streptococcaceae, Caulobacteraceae, and Lactobacillaceac, were detected in the SE group. In contrast, the bacterial families, such as Weeksellaceae, Neisseriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Spirochaetaceae, and Veillonellaceae, were abundantly expressed in the FE group. Five operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were positively correlated with DOB values, while two OTUs exhibited negative trends. These different enriched OTUs were extensively involved in the 20 metabolic pathways. These results suggest that a balanced environment in the oral microbiota contributes to H. pylori eradication and metabolic homeostasis in humans. Our data demonstrated that the changes in oral microbiota might contribute to the therapeutic effects of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, a different therapy on the detrimental oral microbiota will increase the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics on H. pylori infection.","2022-05-31","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-29 17:41:29","","227-239","","2","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human oral; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to compare the fecal microbiome and metabolome of dogs administered enrofloxacin and metronidazole, followed by either a placebo or a bacterial/yeast synbiotic combination. Methods: Twenty-two healthy research dogs were randomized to two treatment groups. There were three study periods: baseline, treatment, and washout. Dogs were administered enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg qd) and metronidazole (12.5 mg/kg BID), followed 1 h later by placebo or a commercially-available synbiotic combination (BID), per os for 21 days with reevaluation 56 days thereafter. Fecal samples were collected on days 5-7 (baseline), 26-28, and 82-84. The fecal microbiome was analyzed by qPCR and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes; time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine metabolomic profiles. Split plot repeated measures mixed model ANOVA was used to compare results between treatment groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant, with Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results: Alpha diversity metrics differed significantly over time in both treatment groups, with incomplete recovery by days 82-84. Beta diversity and the dysbiosis index differed significantly over time and between treatment groups, with incomplete recovery at days 82-84 for dogs in the placebo group. Significant group-by-time interactions were noted for 15 genera, including Adlercreutzia, Bifidobacterium, Slackia, Turicibacter, Clostridium (including C. hiranonis) [Ruminococcus], Erysipelotrichaceae_g_, [Eubacterium], and Succinivibrionaceae_g_. Concurrent group and time effects were present for six genera, including Collinsella, Ruminococcaceae_g_, and Prevotella. Metabolite profiles differed significantly by group-by-time, group, and time for 28, 20, and 192 metabolites, respectively. These included short-chain fatty acid, bile acid, tryptophan, sphingolipid, benzoic acid, and cinnaminic acid metabolites, as well as fucose and ethanolamine. Changes in many taxa and metabolites persisted through days 82-84. Conclusion: Antibiotic administration causes sustained dysbiosis and dysmetabolism in dogs. Significant group-by-time interactions were noted for a number of taxa and metabolites, potentially contributing to decreased antibiotic-induced gastrointestinal effects in dogs administered synbiotics.","2021-05-26","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-07-01 16:16:00","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-canine gut; var-antibiotics; var-disease; var-probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the effects of these agents on microbiota composition in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: A total of 51 adults with T2D (mean +/- SD: age 62.8 +/- 6.9 years, BMI 31.8 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 7.3 +/- 0.6%) treated with metformin and/or sulphonylureas were included in the 12-week randomized, double-blind trial. Patients were given the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (1.8 mg sc) or the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin (100 mg), or matching placebos, once daily for 12 weeks. Faecal samples were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks after the start of the intervention. Microbiota analyses were performed by 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analysis. Bile acids were measured in faeces and plasma. Results: Liraglutide decreased HbA(1c) by 1.3% (95% CI: -1.7 to -0.9) and tended to reduce body weight (-1.7 kg, 95% CI: -3.6 to 0.3), but increased faecal secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid. Sitagliptin lowered HbA(1c) by 0.8% (95% CI: -1.4 to -0.4) while body weight remained stable (-0.8 kg, 95% CI: -2.7 to 1.0), but increased faecal levels of cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. However, neither liraglutide nor sitagliptin affected either alpha or beta diversity of the intestinal microbiota, nor were changes in microbial composition related to clinical parameters. Conclusion: These data suggest that the beneficial effects of liraglutide and sitagliptin on glucose metabolism, body weight and bile acids, when used as add-on therapies to metformin or sulphonylureas, are not linked to changes in the intestinal microbiota (NCT01744236).

A total of 96 individually penned pigs (initial BW = 22.7 +/- 0.65 kg) were allotted to 12 treatments and subjected to a completely randomized block design experiment. Pigs in each treatment were fed an isocaloric wheat-based or corn-based diet with or without 1 of 5 types of xylanase supplements (XA, XB, XC, XD, XE). On d 42, all piglets were euthanized to obtain ileal and cecal digesta for microbial analysis, which involved high-throughput sequencing of the V1 - V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene. Corn- and wheat-based diets differed (P < 0.05) in digestion characteristics. Dietary treatments affected the alpha- and beta-diversities of microbiota in the cecum but not in the ileum. The wheat-based diet increased (P < 0.05) alphadiversity and clustered separately (P < 0.05) compared with the corn-based diet. Wheat-based diet also promoted the relative abundance of genus (g.) Succinivibrio while corn-based diet promoted the proportion of family (f.) Veillonellaceae in the community. Among xylanases, only XC within the wheat-based diet altered (P < 0.05) the beta-diversity of the cecal microbiota compared with control. For each cereal-based diet and compared with the controls, xylanase treatments affected (P < 0.05) the proportions of 5 bacterial taxa in the ileum (f. Peptostreptococcaceae, order [o.] Streptophyta, f. Clostridiaceae, g. Clostridium and g. Streptococcus) and 8 in the cecum (g. Lactobacillus, g. Streptococcus, class [c.] Clostridia, f. Clostridiaceae, g. Megasphaera, g. Prevotella, g. Roseburia and f. Ruminococcaceae). Network analysis showed that across diets under control treatments, Bacteroidetes was the most influential phylum promoting cooperative relationships among members of the ileum and cecum microbiota. Xylanase treatment, however, reduced the influence of Bacteroidetes and promoted a large number of hub taxa majority of which belonged to the Firmicutes phylum. To maximize the efficiency of xylanase supplementation, our data suggest that xylanase C originated from Bacillus subtilis was more effective when applied to wheat-based diets, while xylanase A originated from Fusarium verticillioides was more beneficial when applied to corn-based diets.

Vegetation and soil are key sources of airborne microbiota-the aerobiome. A limited number of studies have attempted to characterize the dynamics of near surface green space aerobiomes, and no studies to date have investigated these dynamics from a vertical perspective. Vertical stratification in the aerobiome could have important implications for public health and for the design, engineering, and management of urban green spaces. OBJECTIVES: The primary objectives of this study were to: a) assess whether significant vertical stratification in bacterial species richness and evenness (alpha diversity) of the aerobiome occurred in a parkland habitat in Adelaide, South Australia; b) assess whether significant compositional differences (beta diversity) between sampling heights occurred; and c) to preliminarily assess whether there were significant altitudinal differences in potentially pathogenic and beneficial bacterial taxa. METHODS: We combined an innovative columnar sampling method at soil level, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2:0 m, using passive petri dish sampling to collect airborne bacteria. We used a geographic information system (GIS) to select study sites, and we used high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to assess whether significant vertical stratification of the aerobiome occurred. RESULTS: Our results provide evidence of vertical stratification in both alpha and beta (compositional) diversity of airborne bacterial communities, with diversity decreasing roughly with height. We also found significant vertical stratification in potentially pathogenic and beneficial bacterial taxa. DISCUSSION: Although additional research is needed, our preliminary findings point to potentially different exposure attributes that may be contingent on human height and activity type. Our results lay the foundations for further research into the vertical characteristics of urban green space aerobiomes and their implications for public health and urban planning.","2020-11","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-30 17:04:42","","","","11","128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impact of gut microbiota following traumatic brain injury (FBI) has not been well established. Our objective was to compare TBI outcomes in specific pathogen-free mice with or without depletion of intestinal bacteria. Adult male C57BL6/J SPF mice (n = 6/group) were randomized to standard drinking water or ampicillin (1 g/L), metronidazole (1 g/L), neomycin (1 g/L), and vancomycin (0.5 g/L) (AMNV) containing drinking water 14 days prior to controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal pellets was performed and alpha and beta diversity determined. Hippocampal neuronal density and microglial activation was assessed 72 h post-injury by immunohistochemistry. In addition, mice (n = 8-12/group) were randomized to AMNV or no treatment initiated immediately after CCI and memory acquisition (fear conditioning) and lesion volume assessed. Mice receiving AMNV had significantly reduced alpha diversity (p < 0.05) and altered microbiota community composition compared to untreated mice (PERMANOVA: p < 0.01). Mice receiving AMNV prior to TBI had increased CAl hippocampal neuronal density (15.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.8 +/- 2.1 cells/0.1 mm; p < 0.05) and a 26.6 +/- 6.6% reduction in Iba-1 positive cells (p < 0.05) at 72 h.

A growing body of research has investigated the human microbiota and pregnancy outcomes, especially preterm birth. Most studies of the prenatal microbiota have focused on the vagina, with fewer investigating other body sites during pregnancy. Although pregnancy involves profound hormonal, immunological and metabolic changes, few studies have investigated either shifts in microbiota composition across pregnancy at different body sites or variation in composition at any site that may be explained by maternal characteristics. The purpose of this study was to investigate: (1) the stability of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota from early (8-14 weeks) through later (24-30 weeks) pregnancy among African American women according to measures of socioeconomic status, accounting for prenatal antibiotic use; (2) whether measures of socioeconomic status are associated with changes in microbiota composition over pregnancy; and (3) whether exposure to prenatal antibiotics mediate any observed associations between measures of socioeconomic status and stability of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota across pregnancy. Methods. We used paired vaginal, oral, or gut samples available for 16S rRNA gene sequencing from two time points in pregnancy (8-14 and 24-30 weeks) to compare within-woman changes in measures of alpha diversity (Shannon and Chaol) and beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) among pregnant African American women (n = 110). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the effect of level of education and prenatal health insurance as explanatory variables for changes in diversity, considering antibiotic exposure as a mediator, adjusting for age, obstetrical history, and weeks between sampling. Results. For the oral and gut microbiota, there were no significant associations between measures of socioeconomic status or prenatal antibiotic use and change in Shannon or Chao 1 diversity. For the vaginal microbiota, low level of education (high school or less) was associated with an increase in Shannon and Chao 1 diversity over pregnancy, with minimal attenuation when controlling for prenatal antibiotic use. Conversely, for within-woman Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for early compared to later pregnancy, low level of education and prenatal antibiotics were associated with greater dissimilarity for the oral and gut sites, with minimal attenuation when controlling for prenatal antibiotics, and no difference in dissimilarity for the vaginal site. Conclusions. Measures of maternal socioeconomic status are variably associated with changes in diversity across pregnancy for the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota, with minimal attenuation by prenatal antibiotic exposure. Studies that evaluate stability of the microbiota across pregnancy in association with health outcomes themselves associated with socioeconomic status (such as preterm birth) should incorporate measures of socioeconomic status to avoid finding spurious relationships.","2019-11-21","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-07-19 18:05:15","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; biome-human oral; biome-human vagina; var-socioeconomic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we investigated whether fasting for Ramadan altered the microbiota in Chinese and Pakistani individuals. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and self-reported dietary intake surveys, we determined that both the microbiota and dietary composition were significantly different with little overlap between ethnic groups. Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCoA) comparison of samples collected from both groups before and after fasting showed partial separation of microbiota related to fasting in the Pakistani group, but not in the Chinese group. Measurement of alpha diversity showed that Ramadan fasting significantly altered the coverage and ACE indices among Chinese subjects, but otherwise incurred no changes among either group. Specifically, Prevotella and Faecalibacterium drove predominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in the Pakistani group, while Bacteroides (phylum Bacteroidetes) were the most prevalent among Chinese participants both before and after fasting. We observed significant enrichment of some specific taxa and depletion of others in individuals of both populations, suggesting that fasting could affect beta diversity. Notably, Dorea, Klebsiella, and Faecalibacterium were more abundant in the Chinese group after fasting, while Sutterella, Parabacteroides, and Alistipes were significantly enriched after fasting in the Pakistani group. Evaluation of the combined groups showed that genera Coprococcus, Clostridium_XlV, and Lachnospiracea were all significantly decreased after fasting. Analysis of food intake and macronutrient energy sources showed that fat-derived energy was positively associated with Oscillibacter and Prevotella, but negatively associated with Bacteroides. In addition, the consumption of sweets was significantly positively correlated with the prevalence of Akkermansia. Our study indicated that diet was the most significant influence on microbiota, and correlated with ethnic groups, while fasting led to enrichment of specific bacterial taxa in some individuals. Given the dearth of understanding about the impacts of fasting on microbiota, our results provide valuable inroads for future study aimed at novel, personalized, behavior-based treatments targeting specific gut microbes for prevention or treatment of digestive disorders.","2021-02-18","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-29 17:10:27","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-diet; var-ethnicity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the composition of gut microbiota in patients with cirrhosis and assessed the effect on it of lactulose administration. Methods: Stool specimens were collected from 35 patients with cirrhosis (male 26; median [range] age: 42 [29-65] years) and 18 healthy controls (male 14; 44.5 [24-67] years); 21 patients provided another specimen after lactulose administration for 55 [42-77] days. For each, a DNA library of V3 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA was subjected to paired-end Illumina sequencing. Inter-specimen relationship was studied using principal co-ordinate analysis. Abundances of various bacterial taxa, and indices of alpha and beta diversity were compared, between patients and controls, and between specimens collected before and after lactulose. Results: Gut microbiota from cirrhosis patients and controls showed differential clustering, and microbiota from patients with cirrhosis had less marked alpha diversity. Abundances of dominant phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) were similar. However, patients with cirrhosis had lower abundances of five phyla, namely Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria, Spirochaetes, Elusimicrobia and Lentisphaerae, and differences in abundances of several families and genera than in controls. Lactulose administration did not lead to any change in alpha and beta diversities, species richness and abundances of various bacterial taxa in gut microbiota. Conclusions: Gut microbiota in cirrhosis differ from healthy persons and do not change following lactulose administration. The latter suggests that the effect of lactulose on hepatic encephalopathy may not be related to alteration in gut microbiota.","2017-11-28","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-30 20:47:56","","","","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-disease","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fertility depends on a receptive state of the endometrium and hormonal adaptations as well as the immune system. Local and systemic immunities are greatly influenced by the microbiota. The aim of the present study was to compare the gut microbiota in female patients with that in infertility with fertile control subjects and to evaluate the effect of prebiotic partially hydrolyzed guar gum supplementation on gut dysbiosis and the outcome of pregnancy in patients treated with assisted reproductive technology. Dietary fiber can reconstitute the host intestinal microbiota and modify the immune function; however, clinical data regarding the effect of dietary fiber treatment on the success of assisted reproductive technology is lacking. To investigate the gut microbiota in fertile and infertile females, we conducted 16S metagenomic analysis of fecal samples. In total 18 fertile female subjects and 18 patients with infertility matched by age were recruited, and fecal samples were obtained to analyze the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing. The unweighted and weighted principal coordinate analyses showed a trend indicating microbial structural differences in beta-diversity between these two groups. The abundance of the phylum Verrucomicrobia was higher in patients with infertility. At the genus level, a decrease in the abundance of the genera Stenotrophomonas, Streptococcus, and Roseburia and an increase in the abundance of the genera Unclassified [Barnesiellaceae] and Phascolarctobacterium was observed in patients with infertility. Twelve patients agreed to receive the combined therapy comprising embryo transfer by assisted reproductive technology and oral supplementation with partially hydrolyzed guar gum. The success of pregnancy by this combined therapy was 58.3% (7/12), and the failure was 41.7% (5/12). Predictive factors for pregnancy before treatment were characterized by a decrease in the abundance of Paraprevotella and Blautia and an increase in the abundance of Bifidobacterium. Predictive factors for pregnancy before treatment were characterized by a decrease in the abundance of Paraprevotella and Blautia and an increase tendency in the abundance of Bifidobacterium.

However, it also seems necessary for effective rumen function, so studies of anti-methanogenic treatments must also consider implications for feed efficiency. Between-animal variation in feed efficiency represents an alternative approach to reducing overall methane emissions intensity. Here we assess the effects of dietary additives designed to reduce methane emissions on the rumen microbiota, and explore relationships with feed efficiency within dietary treatment groups. Seventy-nine finishing steers were offered one of four diets (a forage/concentrate mixture supplemented with nitrate (NIT), lipid (MDDG) or a combination (COMB) compared to the control (CTL)). Rumen fluid samples were collected at the end of a 56 d feed efficiency measurement period. DNA was extracted, multiplexed 16s rRNA libraries sequenced (Illumina MiSeq) and taxonomic profiles were generated. The effect of dietary treatments and feed efficiency (within treatment groups) was conducted both overall (using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and diversity indexes) and for individual taxa. Diet affected overall microbial populations but no overall difference in beta-diversity was observed. The relative abundance of Methanobacteriales (Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera) increased in MDDG relative to CTL, whilst VadinCA11 (Methanomassiliicoccales) was decreased. Trimethylamine precursors from rapeseed meal (only present in CTL) probably explain the differences in relative abundance of Methanomassiliicoccales. There were no differences in Shannon indexes between nominal low or high feed efficiency groups (expressed as feed conversion ratio or residual feed intake) within treatment groups. Relationships between the relative abundance of individual taxa and feed efficiency measures were observed, but were not consistent across dietary treatments.","2020-04-24","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-06-30 17:02:25","","","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior culture based studies have shown associations between occupational exposure to livestock and carriage of specific antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Using shotgun metagenomics, the present study investigated 194 faecal resistomes and bacteriomes from humans occupationally exposed to ARGs in livestock (i.e. pig and poultry farmers, employees and family members and pig slaughterhouse workers) and a control population (Lifelines cohort) in the Netherlands. In addition, we sought to identify determinants for the human resistome and bacteriome composition by applying a combination of multivariate (NMDS, PERMANOVA, SIMPER and DESeq2 analysis) and multivariable regression analysis techniques. Results: Pig slaughterhouse workers and pig farmers carried higher total ARG abundances in their stools compared to broiler farmers and control subjects. Tetracycline, beta-lactam and macrolide resistance gene clusters dominated the resistome of all studied groups. No significant resistome alpha diversity differences were found among the four populations. However, the resistome beta diversity showed a separation of the mean resistome composition of pig and pork exposed workers from broiler farmers and controls, independent of their antimicrobial use. We demonstrated differences in resistome composition between slaughter line positions, pig versus poultry exposed workers, as well as differences between farmers and employees versus family members. In addition, we found a significant correlation between the bacteriome and resistome, and significant differences in the bacteriome composition between and within the studied subpopulations. Finally, an in-depth analysis of pig and poultry farms - of which also farm livestock resistomes were analysed - showed positive associations between the number of on-farm working hours and human faecal AMR loads. Conclusion: We found that the total normalized faecal ARG carriage was larger in persons working in the Dutch pork production chain compared to poultry farmers and controls. Additionally, we showed significant differences in resistome and bacteriome composition of pig and pork exposed workers compared to a control group, as well as within-population (farms, slaughterhouse) compositional differences. The number of on-farm working hours and the farm type (pig or broiler) that persons live or work on are determinants for the human faecal resistome. Overall, our results may suggest direct or indirect livestock contact as a determinant for human ARG carriage. Future studies should further focus on the connection between the human and livestock resistome (i.e. transmission routes) to substantiate the evidence for livestock-associated resistome acquisition.","2020-10","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-07-18 21:59:49","","","","","143","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","biome-human gut; shotgun sequencing; var-antimicrobials; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to determine associations among reported carotenoid intake, plasma carotenoid concentrations, and fecal bacterial communities in pregnant women. Pregnant women (n = 27) were enrolled in a two-arm study designed to assess feasibility of biospecimen collection and delivery of a practical nutrition intervention. Plasma and fecal samples were collected and women were surveyed with a 24-hr dietary checklist and recalls. Plasma carotenoids were analyzed by HPLC using photodiode array detection. Fecal bacteria were analyzed by 16S rRNA DNA sequencing. Results presented are cross-sectional from the 36-week gestational study visit combined across both study arms due to lack of significant differences between intervention and usual care groups (n = 23 women with complete data). Recent intake of carotenoid-containing foods included carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, apricots, and/or bell peppers for 48% of women; oranges/orange juice (17%); egg (39%); tomato/tomato-based sauces (52%); fruits (83%); and vegetables (65%). Average plasma carotenoid concentrations were 6.4 mu g/dL alpha-carotene (AC), 17.7 mu g/dL beta-carotene (BC), 11.4 mu g/dL cryptoxanthin, 39.0 mu g/dL trans-lycopene, and 29.8 mu g/dL zeaxanthin and lutein. AC and BC concentrations were higher in women who recently consumed foods high in carotenoids. CR concentrations were higher in women who consumed oranges/orange juice. Microbiota alpha-diversity positively correlated with AC and BC. Microbiota beta-diversity differed significantly across reported intake of carotenoid containing foods and plasma concentrations of AC.

In the present study the active acidobacterial communities of Namibian soils differing in type, physicochemical parameters, and land use were characterized by high-throughput sequencing. Water content, pH, major ions and nutrients were distinct for sandy soils, woodlands or dry agriculture on loamy sands. Soils were repeatedly sampled over a 2-year time period and covered consecutively a strong rainy, a dry, a normal rainy and a weak rainy season. The increasing drought had differential effects on different soils. Linear modeling of the soil water content across all sampling locations and sampling dates revealed that the accumulated precipitation of the preceding season had only a weak, but statistically significant effect, whereas woodland and irrigation exerted a strong positive effect on water content. The decrease in soil water content was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in the fraction of active Acidobacteria (7.9-0.7%) while overall bacterial community size/cell counts remained constant. Notably, the strongest decline in the relative fraction of Acidobacteria was observed after the first cycle of rainy and dry season, rather than after the weakest rainy season at the end of the observation period. Over the 2-year period, also the beta-diversity of soil Acidobacteria changed. During the first year this change in composition was related to soil type (loamy sand) and land use (woodland) as explanatory variables. A total of 188 different acidobacterial sequence variants affiliated with the “Acidobacteriia,” Blastocatellia, and Vicinamibacteria changed significantly in abundance, suggesting either drought sensitivity or formation of dormant cell forms. Comparative physiological testing of 15 Namibian isolates revealed species-specific and differential responses in viability during long-term continuous desiccation or drying-rewetting cycles. These different responses were not determined by phylogenetic affiliation and provide a first explanation for the effect of drought on soil Acidobacteria. In conclusion, the response of acidobacterial communities to water availability is non-linear, most likely caused by the different physiological adaptations of the different taxa present.","2022-02-11","2022-06-27 16:29:14","2022-07-18 21:47:54","","","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-environmental; biome-soil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sulfites and other food preservatives are added to these foods largely to limit bacterial contamination. The mouth microbiota and its associated enzymes are the first to encounter food and therefore likely to be the most affected. Methods Eight saliva samples from ten individuals were exposed to two sulfite preservatives, sodium sulfite and sodium bisulfite. One sample set was evaluated for bacteria composition utilizing 16s rRNA sequencing, and the number of viable cells in all sample sets was determined utilizing ATP assays at 10 and 40-minute exposure times. All untreated samples were analyzed for baseline lysozyme activity, and possible correlations between the number of viable cells and lysozyme activity. Results Sequencing indicated significant increases in alpha diversity with sodium bisulfite exposure and changes in relative abundance of 3 amplicon sequence variants (ASV). Sodium sulfite treated samples showed a significant decrease in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, a marginally significant change in alpha diversity, and a significant change in the relative abundance for Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and for 6 ASVs. Beta diversity didn't show separation between groups, however, all but one sample set was observed to be moving in the same direction under sodium sulfite treatment. ATP assays indicated a significant and consistent average decrease in activity ranging from 24-46% at both exposure times with both sulfites. Average initial rates of lysozyme activity between all individuals ranged from +/- 76% compared to individual variations of +/- 10-34%. No consistent, significant correlation was found between ATP and lysozyme activity in any sample sets. Conclusions Sulfite preservatives, at concentrations regarded as safe by the FDA, alter the relative abundance and richness of the microbiota found in saliva, and decrease the number of viable cells, within 10 minutes of exposure.","2022","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 17:03:56","","","","4","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary exploratory outcome was the number of UTIs in a 6-month prospective observation period compared with a 6-month retrospective period. Further outcomes included number of antibiotics, quality of life (SF-36), intestinal microbiota (assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), and evaluation questions. Parameters were assessed at baseline and after 1, 2, and 7 months (start of intake of cranberry supplement after 1 month for 6 months). p-Values were calculated with the pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test for alpha diversity and permutational multivariate analysis of variance.Results: Twenty-three women (aged 52.7 +/- 12.4 years) were included in the study.

Humans are known to be a natural host for H. pylori and tend to acquire the pathogen before the age of 5 years. The infection may then persist lifelong if eradication therapy is not applied. One of the modes of transmission of H. pylori is between family members, and therefore, the presence of infected family members is an important risk factor in children. However, other environmental factors have not been fully analyzed. The present study was performed to clarify whether and to what extent intestinal microbiota affect H. pylori intrafamilial infection. The fecal specimens from H. pylori-infected infants and H. pylori-infected and non-infected family members were collected in cohort studies conducted by Sasayama City, Hyogo Prefecture from 2010 to 2013. In total, 18 fecal DNA from 5 families were analyzed. Samples were amplified using 16S rRNA universal primers, and the amplicons were sequenced using the Ion PGM system. Principal-coordinate analysis demonstrated that there was no difference in intestinal microbiota between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative groups. In intrafamilial comparison tests, the Manhattan distance of intestinal microbiota between the H. pylori-infected infant proband and H. pylori-negative mother was nearest in the family with low intestinal microbial diversity. However, in the family with the highest intestinal microbial diversity, the nearest Manhattan distance was shown between the H. pylori-infected infant proband and H. pylori-infected mother. The results in this study showed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota was very similar between members of the same family, and as such, colonization with organisms highly similar to the infected parent(s) may be a risk factor for H. pylori infection in children.","2018-02-21","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-07-19 17:18:59","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; beta diversity; biome-human gut; dist-Manhattan distance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A feeding trial was conducted with fish weighting 70-90 g. Fish were tagged with passive, integrated transponders and distributed in nine 500 L tanks with 40 fish each. Fish were fed for 12 weeks with either a control (diet A) or experimental diets (diets B and C) in triplicate (3 tanks/diet). Extruded pellets of diets B and C were supplemented with a low (2 & times; 109 CFU/kg) and a high (5 & times; 109 CFU/kg) dose of probiotic, respectively. No significant differences were found between groups for the feed conversion ratio or specific growth rates. However, the final body weight of fish fed diet C was significantly higher than the control group with intermediate values for fish fed diet B. Histological analysis conducted using a semi-quantitative scoring system showed that probiotic did not alter the morphology of the intestine and did not trigger inflammation. With regard to the transcriptomic response, a customized PCR array layout was designed to simultaneously profile a panel of 44 selected genes. Significant differences in the expression of key genes involved in innate and acquired immunity were detected between fish fed probiotic and control diets. To analyze the microbiota associated to the feeds and the gut autochthonous microbial communities, we used the Illumina MiSeq platform for sequencing the 16S rRNA gene and a metagenomics pipeline based on VSEARCH and RDP databases. The analysis of gut microbiota revealed a lack of colonization of the probiotic in the host's intestinal mucosa. However, probiotic did modulate the fish gut microbiota, confirming that colonization is not always necessary to induce host modification. In fact, diets B and C were enriched with Actinomycetales, as compared to diet A, which instead showed a higher percentage of Pseudomonas, Sphyngomonas, and Lactobacillus genera. These results were confirmed by the clear separation of gut bacterial community of fish fed with the probiotic from the bacterial community of control fish group in the beta-diversity and PLS-DA (supervised partial least-squares discriminant analysis) analyses. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment","2021-04-12","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 18:55:00","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-diet; var-probiotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To reduce Salmonella shedding and the risk of pork contamination, antibiotic therapy is used and can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Here we hypothesized that immune system education by the microbiota can play a role in intestinal resilience to infection. We used amoxicillin (15mg/Kg) to modulate the intestinal microbiome of 10 piglets, paired with same age pigs that received a placebo (n = 10) from 0 to 14 days of age. Animals were euthanized at 4-weeks old. Each pig donated colon sections for ex vivo culture (n = 20 explants/pig). Explants were inoculated with S. Typhimurium, PBS or LPS (n = 6 explants/pig/group, plus technical controls). The gut bacteriome was characterized by sequencing of the 16S rRNA at 7, 21 days of age, and upon in vitro culture. Explants response to infection was profiled through high-throughput mRNA sequencing. In vivo antibiotic treatment led to beta-diversity differences between groups at all times (P<0.05), while a-diversity did not differ between amoxicillin and placebo groups on day 21 and at euthanasia (P< 0.03 on day 7). Explant microbiomes were not different from in vivo. In vitro challenge with S. Typhimurium led to lower necrosis scores in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs, when compared to explants placebo-treated pigs (P< 0.05). This was coupled with the activation of immune-related pathways in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs (IL-2 production, NO production, BCR activation), when compared to placebo-treated pigs. In addition, several DNA repair and intestinal wound healing pathways were also only activated in explants from amoxicillin-treated pigs. Taken together, these findings suggest that immune education by the amoxicillin-disturbed microbiota may have contributed to mitigate intestinal lesions following pathogen exposure.","2020-04-27","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 17:03:16","","","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We enrolled 56 virally infected (VI) patients (pts): 13 HIV+ on suppressive cART (HIV-RNA < 40cp/ml), 13 HCV+ naive to DAA (direct-acting antiviral) anti-HCV agents; 30 HCV+/HIV+ on suppressive cART and naive to anti-HCV. 13 age-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. For V alpha 7.2+CD161++ and V alpha 7.2+CD161-CD8+ T cells we assessed: activation (CD69), exhaustion (PD1/CD39), and cytolytic activity (granzymeB/perforin). Following PMA/ionomycin and Escherichia coli stimulation we measured intracellular IL17/TNF alpha/IFN gamma. Markers of microbial translocation (Plasma LPS, 16S rDNA, EndoCAb and I-FABP) were quantified. In 5 patients per group we assessed stool microbiota composition by 16S targeted metagenomics sequencing (alpha/beta diversity, relative abundance). Compared to controls, virally infected pts displayed significantly lower circulating V alpha 7.2+CD161++CD8+ MAIT cells (p = 0.001), yet expressed higher perforin (p = 0.004) and granzyme B (p = 0.002) on CD8+ MAIT cells. Upon E. coli stimulation, the residual MAIT cells are less functional particularly those from HIV+/HCV+ patients. Conversely, in virally infected pts, V alpha 7.2+CD161-CD8+ cells were comparable in frequency, highly activated/exhausted (CD69+: p = 0.002; PD-1+: p = 0.030) and with cytolytic potential (perforin+: p < 0.0001), yet were poorly responsive to ex vivo stimulation. A profound gut dysbiosis characterized virally infected pts, especially HCV+/HIV+ co-infected patients, delineating a Firmicutes-poor/Bacteroidetes-rich microbiota, with significant associations with MAIT cell frequency/function. Irrespective of mono/dual infection, HIV+ and HCV+ patients display depleted, yet activated/cytolytic MAIT cells with reduced ex vivo function, suggesting an impoverished pool, possibly due to continuous bacterial challenge. The MAIT cell ability to respond to bacterial stimulation correlates with the presence of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, possibly suggesting an association between gut dysbiosis and MAIT cell function and posing viral-mediated dysbiosis as a potential key player in the hampered anti-bacterial MAIT ability.","2019-08-28","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-07-19 14:54:51","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-disease; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brett","Exposure to Parasitic Protists and Helminths Changes the Intestinal Community Structure of Bacterial Communities in a Cohort of Mother-Child Binomials from a Semirural Setting in Mexico","MSPHERE","","","10.1128/mSphere.00083-21","","An estimated 3.5 billion people are colonized by intestinal parasites worldwide. Intestinal parasitic eukaryotes interact not only with the host but also with the intestinal microbiota. In this work, we studied the relationship between the presence of multiple enteric parasites and the community structures of gut bacteria and eukaryotes in an asymptomatic mother-child cohort from a semirural community in Mexico. Fecal samples were collected from 46 mothers and their respective children, with ages ranging from 2 to 20 months. Mothers and infants were found to be multiparasitized by Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba dispar, Endolimax nana, Chilomastix mesnili, lodamoeba butshlii, Entamoeba coil, Hymenolepis nana, and Ascaris lumbricoides. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes showed a significant effect of parasite exposure on bacterial beta-diversity, which explained between 5.2% and 15.0% of the variation of the bacterial community structure in the cohort. Additionally, exposure to parasites was associated with significant changes in the relative abundances of multiple bacterial taxa, characterized by an increase in Clostridiales and decreases in Actinobacteria and Bacteroidales. Parasite exposure was not associated with changes in intestinal eukaryote relative abundances. However, we found several significant positive correlations between intestinal bacteria and eukaryotes, including Osciliospira with Entamoeba coli and Prevotella stercorea with Entamoeba hartmanni, as well as the co-occurrence of the fungus Candida with Bacteroides and Actinomyces, Bihdobactedum, and Prevotella copri and the fungus Pichia with Oscillospira. The parasitic exposure-associated changes in the bacterial community structure suggest effects on microbial metabolic routes, host nutrient uptake abilities, and intestinal immunity regulation in host-parasite interactions. IMPORTANCE The impact of intestinal eukaryotes on the prokaryotic microbiome composition of asymptomatic carriers has not been extensively explored, especially in infants and mothers with multiple parasitic infections. In this work, we studied the relationship between protist and helminth parasite colonization and the intestinal microbiota structure in an asymptomatic population of mother-child binomials from a semirural community in Mexico. We found that the presence of parasitic eukaryotes correlated with changes in the bacterial gut community structure in the intestinal microbiota in an age-dependent way. Parasitic infection was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of the class Clostridia and decreases of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidia. Parasitic infection was not associated with changes in the eukaryote community structure. However, we observed strong positive correlations between bacterial and other eukaryote taxa, identifying novel relationships between prokaryotes and fungi reflecting interkingdom interactions within the human intestine.","2021-08","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-27 17:26:14","","","","4","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","remove","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NWO is characterized by inflammation and muscle wasting in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Gut microbiota has been implicated in the regulation of host metabolism and may play important roles in the development of NWO in CKD. Methods: In this case-control study, we examined the gut microbial diversity and taxonomy in 96 hemodialysis patients with normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and BF% <= 25% for men or < 35% for women; n = 32), NWO (BMI < 25 kg/m(2) and BF% > 25% for men or > 35% for women; n = 32), and overweight/obesity (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2) ; n = 32), matched for age, gender, and diabetes. BF% was measured using bioimpedance spectroscopy device. Gut microbiota was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results: We found that a-diversity was significantly different among the 3 adiposity phenotypes, with NWO being the least diverse. alpha-diversity was positively correlated with BMI, subjective global assessment score, and physical activity, but negatively correlated with interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Patients with or without NWO were distinguished with respect to principal coordinate analysis of beta-diversity. Notably, the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Coprococcus, was markedly reduced in patients with NWO. Conclusion: Our findings support associations between gut dysbiosis and a proinflammatory and catabolic state in hemodialysis patients with NWO.","2020-06","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-07-19 14:58:26","","2006-2014","","6","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-adiposity; var-disease; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to explore whether letrozole and high-fat diets (HFD) can induce obese insulin-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with intestinal flora dysbiosis in a rat model. We compared the changes in the intestinal flora of letrozole-induced rats fed with HFD or normal chow, to explore the effects of HFD and letrozole independently and synergistically on the intestinal flora. Methods. Five-week-old female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were divided into four groups: control (C) group fed with regular diet; L1 group administered with letrozole and fed with regular diet; L2 group received letrozole and fed with HFD; and HFD group fed with HFD. At the end of the experiment, ovarian morphology, hormones, metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory status of all rats were studied. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing was used to profile microbial communities, and various multivariate analysis approaches were used to quantitate microbial composition, abundance, and diversity. Results. Compared to the C group, the increased plasma fasting insulin and glucose, HOMA-IR, triglyceride, testosterone, and malondialdehyde were significantly higher in the L2 group, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly lower in the L1 group and L2 group. The indices of Chao1 and the Abundance-based Coverage Estimator (ACE) (alpha-diversity) in the L2 and HFD groups were significantly lower than that in the C group. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity based principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plots and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) test showed obvious separations between the L2 group and C group, between the HFD group and C group, and between the L2 and HFD groups. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) were increased in the L2 group; Bacteroidetes was decreased in the L2 and HFD groups. No significant differences in bacterial abundance between the C group and L1 group were observed at the phylum level. Based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis, the bacterial genera (the relative abundance > 0.1%, LDA > 3, p<0.05) were selected as candidate bacterial signatures. They showed that the abundance of Vibrio was significantly increased in the L1 group; Bacteroides and Phascolarctobacterium were enriched in the HFD group, and Bacteroides, Phascolarctobacterium, Blautia, Parabacteroides, Akkermansia [Ruminococcus]_torques_group, and Anaerotruncus were enriched in the L2 group. Conclusion. The effect of letrozole on intestinal flora was not significant as HFD. HFD could destroy the balance of intestinal flora and aggravate the intestinal flora dysbiosis in PCOS. Letrozole-induced rats fed with HFD have many characteristics like human PCOS, including some metabolic disorders and intestinal flora dysbiosis. The dysbiosis was characterized by an increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, an expansion of Firmicutes, a contraction of Bacteroidetes, and the decreased microbial richness. Beta-diversity also showed significant differences in intestinal microflora, compared with control rats.","2021-06-28","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 17:01:04","","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

OBJECTIVE To examine the composition, diversity, and resilience of skin microbiota associated with systemic antibiotic perturbation in individuals with acne. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal cohort study conducted at an academic referral center in Maryland from February 11 to September 23, 2014, included 4 female participants whohad received a recent diagnosis of acne vulgaris, showed comedonal and inflammatory acne on the face, were at least 18 years old, and had no recent use of systemic or topical treatments for acne, including antibiotics and retinoids. Data analysis was performed between July 5, 2017, and November 7, 2018. INTERVENTIONS Participants were prescribed oral minocycline, 100 mg, twice daily for 4 weeks. Skin areas on the forehead, cheek, and chin were sampled for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing at baseline, 4 weeks after starting minocycline treatment, and then 1 week and 8 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Skin microbiota examined with respect to relative abundance of bacterial taxa, adiversity(represents within-sample microbial diversity), and beta diversity(represents between-sample microbial diversity). Acne status evaluated with photography and lesion count. RESULTS Of the 4 patients included in this study, 2 were 25 years old, 1 was 29 years old, and 1 was 35 years old; 2 were white women, 1 was an African American woman, and 1 was an Asian woman. A cross all 4 patients, antibiotic treatment was associated with a 1.4-fold reduction in the level of Cacnes (difference, -10.3%; 95% CI, -19.9% to -0.7%; P=.04) with recovery following cessation of treatment. Distinct patterns of change were identified in multiple bacterial genera, including a transient 5.6-fold increase in the relative abundance of Pseudomonas species (difference, 2.2%; 95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%; P<.001) immediately following antibiotic treatment, as well as a persistent 1.7-fold increase in the relative abundance of Streptococcus species (difference, 5.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-10.6%; P=.04) and a 4.7-fold decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species(difference, -0.8%; 95% CI,-1.4% to-0.2%; P=.02) 8 weeks following antibiotic treatment withdrawal. In general, antibiotic administration was associated with an initial decrease from baseline of bacterial diversity followed by recovery. Principal coordinates analysis results showed moderate clustering of samples by patient (analysis of similarity, R=0.424; P=.001) and significant clustering of samples by time in one participant (analysis of similarity, R=0.733; P=.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, systemic antibiotic treatment of acne was associated with changes in the composition and diversity of skin microbiota, with variable rates of recovery across individual patients and parallel changes in specific bacterial populations. Understanding the association between systemic antibiotic use and skin microbiota may help clinicians decrease the likelihood of skin comorbidities related to microbial dysbiosis.","2019-04","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 16:59:06","","425-434","","4","155","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The risks and benefits of antibiotic treatment in individuals with such cases are unknown. Fecal samples of NAAT-positive, toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-negative patients were collected before, during, and after randomization to vancomycin (n = 8) or placebo (n = 7). C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) were selectively cultured from fecal and environmental samples. Shotgun metagenomics and comparative isolate genomics were used to understand the impact of oral vancomycin on the microbiome and environmental contamination. Overall, 80% of placebo patients and 71% of vancomycin patients were colonized with C. difficile posttreatment. One person randomized to placebo subsequently received treatment for CDI. In the vancomycin-treated group, beta-diversity (P= 0.0059) and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) resistance genes (P= 0.037) increased after treatment; C. difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) environmental contamination was found in 53% of patients and 26% of patients, respectively. We found that vancomycin alters the gut microbiota, does not permanently clear C. difficile, and is associated with VRE colonization/environmental contamination. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT03388268.) IMPORTANCE A gold standard diagnostic for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) does not exist. An area of controversy is how to manage patients whose stool tests positive by nucleic acid amplification tests but negative by toxin enzyme immunoassay. Existing data suggest most of these patients do not have CDI, but most are treated with oral vancomycin. Potential benefits to treatment include a decreased risk for adverse outcomes if the patient does have CDI and the potential to decrease C. difficile shedding/transmission. However, oral vancomycin perturbs the intestinal microbiota and promotes antibiotic-resistant organism colonization/transmission. We conducted a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to assess the risk-benefit of oral vancomycin treatment in this population. Oral vancomycin did not result in long-term clearance of C. difficile, perturbed the microbiota, and was associated with colonization/shedding of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. This work underscores the need to better understand this population of patients in the context of C. difficile/ARO-related outcomes and transmission.","2021-02","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 19:43:23","","","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","shotgun sequencing; var-disease; biome-human gut; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SIT relies on the effective mating of laboratory-reared strains and natural populations, and therefore requires an efficient mass-rearing system that will allow for the production of high-quality males. Adaptation of wild flies to an artificial laboratory environment can be accompanied by negative effects on several life history traits through changes in their genetic diversity and symbiotic communities. Such changes may lead to reduced biological quality and mating competitiveness in respect to the wild populations. Profiling wild populations can help understand, and maybe reverse, deleterious effects accompanying laboratory domestication thus providing insects that can efficiently and effectively support SIT application.ResultsIn the present study, we analyzed both the genetic structure and gut symbiotic communities of natural medfly populations of worldwide distribution, including Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The genetic structure of 408 individuals from 15 distinct populations was analyzed with a set of commonly used microsatellite markers. The symbiotic communities of a subset of 265 individuals from 11 populations were analyzed using the 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing of single individuals (adults). Genetic differentiation was detected among geographically distant populations while adults originated from neighboring areas were genetically closer. Alpha and beta diversity of bacterial communities pointed to an overall reduced symbiotic diversity and the influence of the geographic location on the bacterial profile.ConclusionsOur analysis revealed differences both in the genetic profile and the structure of gut symbiotic communities of medfly natural populations. The genetic analysis expanded our knowledge to populations not analyzed before and our results were in accordance with the existing scenarios regarding this species expansion and colonization pathways. At the same time, the bacterial communities from different natural medfly populations have been characterized, thus broadening our knowledge on the microbiota of the species across its range. Genetic and symbiotic differences between natural and laboratory populations must be considered when designing AW-IPM approaches with a SIT component, since they may impact mating compatibility and mating competitiveness of the laboratory-reared males. In parallel, enrichment from wild populations and/or symbiotic supplementation could increase rearing productivity, biological quality, and mating competitiveness of SIT-important laboratory strains.","2020-12-18","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-29 17:05:58","","","","2, SI","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fly gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A significant proportion of patients also have gastrointestinal symptoms, including malabsorption, chronic diarrhea, and obstipation. The pathological background of the gastrointestinal symptoms remains incompletely understood and involves multiple factors, with autoimmunity being the most common underlying cause. Patients with APECED have increased immune responses against gut commensals. Our objective was to evaluate whether the intestinal microbiota composition, predicted functions or fungal abundance differ between Finnish patients with APECED and healthy controls, and whether these associate to the patients' clinical phenotype and gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods DNA was isolated from fecal samples from 15 patients with APECED (median age 46.4 years) together with 15 samples from body mass index matched healthy controls. DNA samples were subjected to analysis of the gut microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, imputed metagenomics using the PICRUSt2 algorithm, and quantitative PCR for fungi. Extensive correlations of the microbiota with patient characteristics were determined. Results Analysis of gut microbiota indicated that both alpha- and beta-diversity were altered in patients with APECED compared to healthy controls. The fraction of Faecalibacterium was reduced in patients with APECED while that of Atopobium spp. and several gram-negative genera previously implicated in biofilm formation, e.g. Veillonella, Prevotella, Megasphaera and Heamophilus, were increased in parallel to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in imputed metagenomics. The differences in gut microbiota were linked to patient characteristics, especially the presence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions Gut microbiota of patients with APECED is altered and enriched with predominantly gram-negative bacterial taxa that may promote biofilm formation and lead to increased exposure to LPS in the patients. The most pronounced alterations in the microbiota were associated with more severe gastrointestinal symptoms.","2021-07-22","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-07-19 15:05:26","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-disease; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to provide this service at Stony Brook University Hospital, we initiated an open-label prospective study of single colonoscopic FMT among patients with >= 2 recurrences of CDI, with the intention of monitoring microbial composition in the recipient before and after FMT, as compared with their respective donor. We also initiated a concurrent open label prospective trial of single colonoscopic FMT of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) not responsive to therapy, after obtaining an IND permit (IND 15642). To characterize how FMT alters the fecal microbiota in patients with recurrent Clostridia difficile infections (CDI) and/or UC, we report the results of a pilot microbiome analysis of 11 recipients with a history of 2 or more recurrences of C. difficile infections without inflammatory bowel disease (CDI-only), 3 UC recipients with recurrent C. difficile infections (CDI + UC), and 5 UC recipients without a history of C. difficile infections (UC-only). Method V3V4 Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was performed on the pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, and 3-months post-FMT recipient fecal samples along with those collected from the healthy donors. Fitted linear mixed models were used to examine the effects of Group (CDI-only, CDI + UC, UC-only), timing of FMT (Donor, pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, 3-months post-FMT) and first order Group*FMT interactions on the diversity and composition of fecal microbiota. Pairwise comparisons were then carried out on the recipient vs. donor and between the pre-FMT, 1-week post-FMT, and 3-months post-FMT recipient samples within each group. Results Significant effects of FMT on overall microbiota composition (e.g., beta diversity) were observed for the CDI-only and CDI + UC groups. Marked decreases in the relative abundances of the strictly anaerobic Bacteroidetes phylum, and two Firmicutes sub-phyla associated with butyrate production (Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae) were observed between the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. There were corresponding increases in the microaerophilic Proteobacteria phylum and the Firmicutes/Bacilli group in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipient groups. At a more granular level, significant effects of FMT were observed for 81 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in at least one of the three recipient groups (p<0.00016 with Bonferroni correction). Pairwise comparisons of the estimated pre-FMT recipient/donor relative abundance ratios identified 6 Gammaproteobacteria OTUs, including the Escherichia-Shigella genus, and 2 Fusobacteria OTUs with significantly increased relative abundance in the pre-FMT samples of all three recipient groups (FDR < 0.05), however the magnitude of the fold change was much larger in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients than in the UC-only recipients. Depletion of butyrate producing OTUs, such as Faecalibacterium, in the CDI-only and CDI + UC recipients, were restored after FMT. Conclusion The results from this pilot study suggest that the microbial imbalances in the CDI + UC recipients more closely resemble those of the CDI-only recipients than the UC-only recipients.","2018-01-31","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 17:02:27","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early-life iron deficiency may alter the developing microbiota, which may or may not be reversible with subsequent dietary iron repletion. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether early-life iron deficiency and subsequent repletion alter colonic microbial composition and fermentation end-product concentrations in pigs. Methods: Forty-two male pigs received either control (CONT, 21.3mg Fe/L) or iron-deficient (ID, 2.72mg Fe/L) milk replacer treatments from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 32. Subsequently, 20 pigs continued through a series of age-appropriate, iron-adequate diets from PND 33 to 61. Contents from the ascending colon (AC) and rectum (feces) were collected at PND 32 and/or 61. Assessments included microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations by gas chromatography methods. Data were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA and PERMANOVA to assess the main effects of early-life iron status on all outcomes. Results: In AC samples, 15 genera differed (P < 0.05) between ID and CONT pigs, while 27 genera differed (P < 0.05) in fecal samples at PND 32. Early-life ID pigs had higher (P = 0.012) relative abundance of Lactobacillus in AC samples compared with CONT pigs. In feces, ID pigs had lower (P < 0.05) relative abundances of Bacteroides and Clostridium from the families of Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae. At PND 61, only two genera differed between treatment groups in AC samples, with ID pigs having a higher (P = 0.043) relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and lower (P = 0.047) relative abundance of Prevotella. Beta diversity differed at PND 32 in both AC and feces between CONT and ID pigs but no differences remained at PND 61. At PND 32, the total VFA concentration was higher in ID pigs compared with CONT pigs in both AC (P = 0.003) and feces (P = 0.001), but no differences in VFA concentrations persisted to PND 61. Conclusion: Early-life iron status influenced microbial composition and VFA concentrations within the large intestine, but these differences were largely normalized following subsequent dietary iron repletion.","2019-08-07","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-07-19 17:22:00","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-diet; var-disorder; biome-pig gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twenty Murrah buffaloes were fed a basal diet (consisting of maize silage, brewers' grains, and concentrate mixture) for 6 weeks supplemented with 0 (control), 15 (MP15), 25 (MP25), and 35 (MP35) g of mixed phytogenic/buffalo per d. The mixed phytogenic contained fennel (seeds), ajwain (seeds), ginger (tubers),Swertia chirata(leaves),Citrullus colocynthis(fruit), turmeric, fenugreek (seeds),Terminalia chebula(fruit), licorice (roots), andPhyllanthus emblica(fruit) in equal quantities. After 2 weeks of adaptation, daily milk yield, and weekly milk composition were recorded. On the last day of the experiment (d 42), rumen contents were collected to determine rumen fermentation parameters and bacterial diversity through 16S rRNA sequencing. Results revealed no change in dry matter intake, milk yield and rumen fermentation parameters except pH, which increased (P= 0.029) in response to MP supplementation. The mixed phytogenic increased (P< 0.01) milk fatty acids (C4 to C14:0) in MP15 only. The milk C16:1 content and its unsaturation index were higher (P< 0.05) in MP35 as compared to the control and other treatments. Furthermore, C18:3n3 was higher (P< 0.05) in the control, MP15, and MP25, as compared to MP35. Supplementation of MP tended to increase (P= 0.095) the Shannon index of bacterial alpha diversity and a difference (P< 0.05) among treatment groups was observed in beta diversity. Feeding MP increased theFirmicutes, Proteobacteria, andSpirochaetesbut decreasedBacteroidetesnumerically. In addition, the dominant genusPrevotelladecreased in all treatment groups whilePseudobutyrivibrio, Butyrivibrio, andSuccinivibrioanceaeincreased numerically in MP25 and MP35. The mixed phytogenic promoted groups of rumen bacteria positively associated with milk and fat yield. Overall, our study revealed 14 positive correlations of rumen bacteria with milk yield and eight with rumen fermentation parameters. Our findings reveal substantial changes in the rumen bacteriome composition and milk fatty acid content in response to MP but these results should be interpreted carefully, as the sample size of our study was relatively small.","2020-08-26","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 16:51:28","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-buffalo rumen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stool collected on fecal occult blood test (FOBT) cards that can be mailed provides an effective solution; however, the quality of sequencing resulting from this method is unknown. The aim of this study is to compare microbiota metrics of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing from stool and meconium collected on FOBT cards with stool collected in an Eppendorf tube (ET) under different conditions. Methods: Eight stool samples from children in diapers aged 0 month-2 years and three meconium samples were collected and stored as follows: (1) = 2 days at room temperature (RT) in an ET, (2) 7 days at -80 degrees C in an ET, (3) 3-5 days at RT on a FOBT card, (4) 7 days at RT on a FOBT card, and (5) 7 days at -80 degrees C on a FOBT card. Samples stored at -80 degrees C were frozen immediately. Each specimen/condition underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing with replicates on the Illumina MiSeq. Alpha and beta diversity measures and relative abundance of major phyla were compared between storage conditions and container (ET vs. FOBT card), with pairwise comparison between different storage conditions and the “standard” of 7 days at -80 degrees C in an ET and fresh stool in an ET. Results: Stool samples clustered mainly by individual diaper (P < 10-5, Adonis), rather than by storage condition (P = 0.42) or container (P = 0.16). However, meconium samples clustered more by container (P = 0.002) than by individual diaper (P = 0.009) and storage condition (P = 0.02). Additionally, there were no differences in alpha diversity measures and relative abundance of major phyla after Bonferroni correction between stool stored on a FOBT card at RT for 7 days with stool stored in an ET tube at -80 degrees C; differences in alpha diversity were seen however when compared to fresh stool in an ET. Overall, based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the different storage containers/conditions are reliable in preserving the microbial memberships and slightly less reliable in preserving the alpha diversity and relative microbial composition of infant stool. Conclusions: Acknowledging certain limitations, FOBT cards may be a useful tool in large-scale stool microbiota studies in children requiring outpatient follow-up where only small amounts of stool can be obtained, but should not be used when studying meconium.","2017-09-05","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 20:31:34","","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-human gut; var-sampling methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that changes in mucosal immune cells characterize IBS and key changes in immune composition are associated with the mucosa-associated microbiota (MaM). METHODS: A nested case-control study (48 IBS and 106 controls included) from 745 colonoscopy participants in a random population sample. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs)/100 enterocytes and eosinophils/5 nonoverlapping high-power fields counted; mast cells identified by immunocytochemistry (CD117)/5 high-power fields. Paneth cells quantified per 5 crypts. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing performed on available sigmoid MaM, n = 55 and fecal microbiota, n = 20. Microbiota profiles compared between samples with high and low IEL counts. RESULTS: IBS had increased IELs in the terminal ileum (relative risk ratio = 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.76, P = 0.022 adjusted for age, sex, and smoking). Cecal IELs were increased in IBS-diarrhea (relative risk ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval 1.13-3.63, P = 0.017). No difference was observed in alpha diversity of MaM or fecal microbiota based on IEL count. There was no difference in beta diversity of the MaM according to IEL count in the terminal ileal (TI) (P = 0.079). High TI IEL counts associated with a significant expansion of the genus Blautia (P = 0.024) and unclassified Clostridiales (P = 0.036) in colon MaM. DISCUSSION: A modest but significant increase in IELs was observed in IBS vs. controls in a population-based setting. Subtle TI and cecal inflammation may play a pathogenic role in IBS but needs confirmation. Modest but discernible differences in the colonic MaM were seen according to TI IEL count but not IBS status.","2021-01","2022-06-27 16:29:15","2022-06-30 17:02:08","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The herbal mixture contained an equal quantity of black pepper (fruit), ginger (tubers), cinnamon (bark), peppermint (leaves), ajwain (seeds) and garlic (bulbs). After two weeks of adaptation, daily milk yield, and weekly milk composition were recorded. On the last day of the experiment, rumen contents were collected to determine rumen fermentation parameters and bacterial diversity through 16S rRNA sequencing. Results revealed no effect of treatment on dry matter intake (DMI), rumen fermentation parameters, and daily milk yield. However, milk fat (%) showed a tendency to increase (pD 0:07) in HM20 as compared with the control group. A significant increase in mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids (C14:1, C16:1, C18:2n6 and C18:3) whereas a decrease in saturated fatty acids (C18:0) in milk was observed in HM20 as compared with the control group. No significant change in bacterial diversity parameters (alpha and beta diversity) was observed in response to the treatment. Despite the substantial variation observed in the relative abundance of bacteria among treatment groups, no significant effect of treatment was observed when compared with the control group. Correlation analysis revealed several positive and negative correlations of rumen bacteria with rumen volatile fatty acids (VFA) and milk yield traits. Bacterial genera including Succinivibrionaceae, Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, and Lachnospiraceae showed a positive correlation with VFA and milk yield traits.

It has been demonstrated that NH3 can cause a series of damage to animals and human. However, toxicity evaluation of NH3 on farm animals was rarely reported, especially in the intestinal microflora. Therefore, in this study, twenty-four 125-day old fattening pigs were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, NH3 group (88.2 mg m(-3) < NH3 concentration < 90.4 mg m(-3)), Se group (Se content: 0.5 mg kg(-1)), and NH3 + Se group (88.2 mg m(-3) < NH3 concentration < 90.4 mg m(-3), Se content: 0.5 mg kg 1), and the effects of NH3 and L-Selenomethionine on the microbiota composition in the jejunum and the levels of inflammatory markers in feces of fattening pigs were examined by 16S rDNA and ELISA, respectively. Our results showed that the content of Matrix metalloproteinase9 (MMP-9), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Lactoferrin (LTF) and Calprotectin in the ammonia group (A group) were significantly elevated compared to the control group, and the content of MMP-9, MPO, LTF and Calprotectin in the A + Se group were significantly reduced. A significant difference in microbiota composition in the phylum, class, family and genus levels was found in the A group and the NH3 + Se group. There was a negative correlation between Streptococcus and Calprotectin. Our results indicated that excessive NH3 inhalation could cause changes in inflammatory markers and beta diversity of intestinal microflora in fattening pigs. We found there was a positive correlation between MPO and Pseudomonas. In addition, we first proposed that L-Selenomethionine could improve the imbalance of microbial flora and the inflammatory injury caused by NH3. Changes in intestinal microflora and inflammatory markers can be used as important indicators to evaluate NH3 toxicity, and studying changes in intestinal microflora is also an important mechanism to reveal NH3 toxicity.","2021-01-15","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-07-19 15:16:37","","","","","208","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-environmental; biome-pig gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Magnolol and honokiol, natural compounds extracted from Magnolia officinalis, exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and antibacterial activities. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplemental magnolol and honokiol in broilers infected with S. pullorum. A total of 360 one-day-old broilers were selected and randomly divided into four groups with six replicates: the negative control group (CTL), S. pullorum-infected group (SP), and the S. pullorum-infected group supplemented with 300 mg/kg honokiol (SPH) or magnolol (SPM). Results The results showed that challenging with S. pullorum impaired growth performance in broilers, as indicated by the observed decreases in body weight (P < 0.05) and average daily gains (P < 0.05), along with increased spleen (P < 0.01) and bursa of Fabricus weights (P < 0.05), serum globulin contents, and the decreased intestine villus height and villus/crypt ratios (P < 0.05). Notably, supplemental magnolol and honokiol attenuated these adverse changes, and the effects of magnolol were better than those of honokiol. Therefore, we performed RNA-Seq in ileum tissues and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of ileum bacteria. Our analysis revealed that magnolol increased the alpha-diversity (observed species, Chao1, ACE, and PD whole tree) and beta-diversity of the ileum bacteria (P < 0.05). In addition, magnolol supplementation increased the abundance of Lactobacillus (P < 0.01) and decreased unidentified Cyanobacteria (P < 0.05) both at d 14 and d 21. Further study confirmed that differentially expressed genes induced by magnolol and honokiol supplementation enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, in the intestinal immune network for IgA production, and in the cell adhesion molecule pathways. Conclusions Supplemental magnolol and honokiol alleviated S. pullorum-induced impairments in growth performance, and the effect of magnolol was better than that of honokiol, which could be partially due to magnolol's ability to improve the intestinal microbial and mucosal barrier.","2021-08-09","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-06-30 19:35:45","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-disease; biome-poultry gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key point in this process is the pool of enzymes secreted by microorganisms. Hence, exogenous enzymes from additives are important for high-production dairy cows to improve the utilization of feeds. In this study, we used the Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger co-cultivation extract (AOAN) to improve the digestibility of roughage and total mixed ration in vitro. Our results indicated that the digestibility of nutrients in feeds was significantly increased by AOAN supplementation, except for the digestibility of crude protein in the total mixed ratio (TMR). Furthermore, the diversity of the bacteria in TMR and oat hay was increased with AOAN supplementation. Although broad effectiveness of AOAN was established, regardless of roughage types, the mechanism may be different according to roughage types. AOAN may provide enzymes to improve the digestibility of feeds and enhance rumen fermentation. This study determined the effects of AOAN on digestibility, fermentation characteristics, and bacterial composition using in vitro gas recording fermentation system. A total of 30 mg of AOAN was supplemented into 500 mg of TMR, corn silage, oat hay, and alfalfa hay. Fermentation parameters and bacterial communities were determined after 48 h fermentation, and digestibility was determined after 7, 24, 30, and 48 h fermentation. Gas production and dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) digestibility were significantly increased by AOAN supplementation at 48 h (p < 0.05), except for digestibility of CP of the TMR (p > 0.05). AOAN increased starch digestibility in corn silage (p < 0.05) and tended to increase that in TMR (0.05 < p < 0.10). AOAN supplementation increased total volatile fatty acid production (p < 0.05). The molar proportions of acetate and acetate to propionate ratio of oat hay and alfalfa hay were increased (p < 0.05). The 16S rRNA analysis revealed that the microbial richness of TMR and oat hay, and microbial evenness of TMR were increased (p < 0.05). AOAN did not affect the alpha diversity, beta diversity, and bacterial composition of the corn silage. The relative abundance of Prevotella was increased and Ruminococcus was decreased in TMR, oat hay, and alfalfa hay. In conclusion, results suggest that AOAN has the potential to improve the utilization of diets differently, including providing enzymes with changing microbiota (TMR, oat hay, and alfalfa hay) or providing enzymes alone (corn silage).","2021-05","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-07-19 19:44:57","","","","5","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-cattle rumen; var-diet; var-fermentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antimicrobials (AM) have an immediate effect on microbial diversity and composition in the gut, but next to nothing is known about their long-term contribution to saliva microbiota. Our objectives were to investigate the long-term impact of AM use on saliva microbiota diversity and composition in preadolescents. We compared the lifetime effects by gender and AMs. We used data from 808 randomly selected children in the Finnish Health In Teens (Fin-HIT) cohort with register-based data on AM purchases from the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Saliva microbiota was assessed with 16S rRNA (V3-V4) sequencing. The sequences were aligned to the SILVA ribosomal RNA database and classified and counted using the mothur pipeline. Associations between AM use and alpha-diversity (Shannon index) were identified with linear regression, while associations between beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) and low, medium or high AM use were identified with PERMANOVA. Results: Of the children, 53.6% were girls and their mean age was 11.7 (0.4) years. On average, the children had 7.4 (ranging from 0 to 41) AM prescriptions during their lifespan. The four most commonly used AMs were amoxicillin (n= 2622, 43.7%), azithromycin (n= 1495, 24.9%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (n= 1123, 18.7%) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (n= 408, 6.8%). A linear inverse association was observed between the use of azithromycin and Shannon index (b- 0.015,pvalue = 0.002) in all children, the effect was driven by girls (b- 0.032,pvalue = 0.001), while not present in boys. Dissimilarities were marked between high, medium and low users of all AMs combined, in azithromycin users specifically, and in boys with amoxicillin use. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate use was associated with the largest decrease in abundance ofRikenellaceae. AM use in general and phenoxymethylpenicillin specifically were associated with a decrease ofPaludibacterand pathways related to amino acid degradations differed in proportion between high and low AM users. Conclusions: A systematic approach utilising reliable registry data on lifetime use of AMs demonstrated long-term effects on saliva microbiota diversity and composition. These effects are gender- and AM-dependent. We found that frequent lifelong use of AMs shifts bacterial profiles years later, which might have unforeseen health impacts in the future. Our findings emphasise a concern for high azithromycin use, which substantially decreases bacterial diversity and affects composition as well. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical implications of our findings.","2020-08-21","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-07-18 22:19:17","","","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-antibiotics; var-antimicrobials; dist-Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; biome-human oral","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (body weight). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters. Results: Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino acid fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish. Conclusion: DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.","2019-10-29","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-06-30 18:55:53","","","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-fish gut; var-growth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They successionally mature to deliver a suite of ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water retention and nutrient cycling, and climate regulation. Biocrust assemblages are extremely well adapted to survive desiccation and to rapidly take advantage of the periodic precipitation events typical of arid ecosystems. Here we focus on the wetting response of incipient cyanobacterial crusts as they mature from “light” to “dark.” We sampled a cyanobacterial biocrust chronosequence before (dry) and temporally following a controlled wetting event and used high-throughput 16S rRNA and rRNA gene sequencing to monitor the dynamics of microbial response. Overall, shorter-term changes in phylogenetic beta diversity attributable to periodic wetting were as large as those attributable to biocrust successional stage. Notably, more mature crusts showed significantly higher resistance to precipitation disturbance. A large bloom of a few taxa within the Firmicutes, primarily in the order Bacillales, emerged 18 h after wetting, while filamentous crust-forming cyanobacteria showed variable responses to wet-up across the successional gradient, with populations collapsing in less-developed light crusts but increasing in later-successional-stage dark crusts. Overall, the consistent Bacillales bloom accompanied by the variable collapse of pioneer cyanobacteria of the Oscillatoriales order across the successional gradient suggests that the strong response of few organisms to a hydration pulse with the mortality of the autotroph might have important implications for carbon (C) balance in semiarid ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Desert biological soil crusts are terrestrial topsoil microbial communities common to arid regions that comprise 40% of Earth's terrestrial surface. They successionally develop over years to decades to deliver a suite of ecosystem services of local and global significance. Ecosystem succession toward maturity has been associated with both resistance and resilience to disturbance. Recent work has shown that the impacts of both climate change and physical disturbance on biocrusts increase the potential for successional resetting. A larger proportion of biocrusts are expected to be at an early developmental stage, hence increasing susceptibility to changes in precipitation frequencies. Therefore, it is essential to characterize how biocrusts respond to wetting across early developmental stages. In this study, we document the wetting response of microbial communities from a biocrust chronosequence. Overall, our results suggest that the cumulative effects of altered precipitation frequencies on the stability of biocrusts will depend on biocrust maturity.","2018-04","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-07-19 19:28:54","","","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-soil; var-treatment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because of its strong negative impact on prognosis and its multifactorial nature that is still not fully understood, cachexia remains an important challenge in the field of cancer treatment. Recent animal studies indicate that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis and manifestation of cancer cachexia, but human data are lacking. The present study investigates gut microbiota composition, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and inflammatory parameters in human cancer cachexia. Methods Faecal samples were prospectively collected in patients (N = 107) with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, or ovarian cancer. Household partners (N = 76) of the patients were included as healthy controls with similar diet and environmental conditions. Patients were classified as cachectic if they lost >5% body weight in the last 6 months. Gut microbiota composition was analysed by sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 gene region. Faecal SCFA levels were quantified by gas chromatography. Faecal calprotectin was assessed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum C-reactive protein and leucocyte counts were retrieved from medical records. Results Cachexia prevalence was highest in pancreatic cancer (66.7%), followed by ovarian cancer (25%), lung cancer (20.8%), and breast cancer (17.3%). Microbial alpha-diversity was not significantly different between cachectic cancer patients (N = 33), non-cachectic cancer patients (N = 74), or healthy controls (N = 76) (species richness P = 0.31; Shannon effective index P = 0.46). Community structure (beta-diversity) tended to differ between these groups (P = 0.053), although overall differences were subtle and no clear clustering of samples was observed. Proteobacteria (P < 0.001), an unknown genus from the Enterobacteriaceae family (P < 0.01), and Veillonella (P < 0.001) were more abundant among cachectic cancer patients. Megamonas (P < 0.05) and Peptococcus (P < 0.001) also showed differential abundance. Faecal levels of all SCFA tended to be lower in cachectic cancer patients, but only acetate concentrations were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). Faecal calprotectin levels were positively correlated with the abundance of Peptococcus, unknown Enterobacteriaceae, and Veillonella. We also identified several correlations and interactions between clinical and microbial parameters. Conclusions This clinical study provided the first insights into the alterations of gut microbiota composition and SCFA levels that occur in cachectic cancer patients and how they are related to inflammatory parameters. These results pave the way for further research examining the role of the gut microbiota in cancer cachexia and its potential use as therapeutic target.","2021-12","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-07-19 17:15:28","","2007-2021","","6","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-disease; var-disorder; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies have emphasized the crosstalk between gut and brain, highlighting how gut composition can influence behavior and brain functions. Thus, the present study investigates the relationship between PANS/PANDAS and gut microbiota ecology. The gut composition of a cohort of 30 patients with PANS/PANDAS was analyzed and compared to control subjects using 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. Data were analyzed for their alpha- and beta-diversity; differences in bacterial distribution were detected by Wilcoxon and LEfSe tests, while metabolic profile was predicted via PICRUSt software. These analyses demonstrate the presence of an altered bacterial community structure in PANS/PANDAS patients with respect to controls. In particular, ecological analysis revealed the presence of two main clusters of subjects based on age range. Thus, to avoid age bias, data from patients and controls were split into two groups: 4-8 years old and > 9 years old. The younger PANS/PANDAS group was characterized by a strong increase in Bacteroidetes; in particular, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, and Oscillospira were identified as potential microbial biomarkers of this composition type. Moreover, this group exhibited an increase of several pathways concerning the modulation of the antibody response to inflammation within the gut as well as a decrease in pathways involved in brain function (i.e., SCFA, D-alanine and tyrosine metabolism, and the dopamine pathway). The older group of patients displayed a less uniform bacterial profile, thus impairing the identification of distinct biomarkers. Finally, Pearson's analysis between bacteria and anti-streptolysin O titer reveled a negative correlation between genera belonging to Firmicutes phylum and anti-streptolysin O while a positive correlation was observed with Odoribacter. In conclusion, this study suggests that streptococcal infections alter gut bacterial communities leading to a pro-inflammatory status through the selection of specific bacterial strains associated with gut inflammation and immune response activation. These findings highlight the possibility of studying bacterial biomarkers associated with this disorder and might led to novel potential therapeutic strategies.","2018-04-06","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-07-19 15:07:35","","","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; var-disease; biome-human gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early life microbial colonization may affect the development of innate and adaptive immunity and may contribute to lasting effects on health and resilience of broiler chickens. We inoculated broiler chickens with adult-derived-microbiota (AM) to investigate their effects on intestinal microbiota composition and natural killer (NK) cells, amongst other immune cells. We hypothesized that AM inoculation directly upon hatch (day 0) would induce an alteration in microbiota composition shortly after hatch, and subsequently affect (subsets of) intestinal NK cells and their activation. Microbiota composition of caecal and ileal content of chickens of 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 35 days of age was assessed by sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. In parallel, subsets and activation of intestinal NK cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. In caecal content of 1- and 3-day-old AM chickens, a higher alpha-diversity (Faith's phylogenetic diversity) was observed compared to control chickens, whereas ileal microbiota were unaffected. Regarding beta-diversity, caecal microbiota profiles could be clustered into three distinct community types. Cluster A represented caecal microbiota of 1-day-old AM chickens and 1- and 3-day-old control chickens. Cluster B included microbiota of seven of eight 3- and 7-day-old AM and 7-day-old control chickens, and cluster C comprised microbiota of all chickens of 14-days and older, independent of inoculation. In 3-day-old AM chickens an increase in the percentages of intestinal IL-2R alpha+NK cells and activated NK cells was observed compared to control chickens of the same age. In addition, an increase in relative numbers of intestinal cytotoxic CD8 alpha alpha T+ cells was observed in 14- and 21-day-old AM chickens. Taken together, these results indicate that early exposure to AM shapes and accelerates the maturation of caecal microbiota, which is paralleled by an increase in IL-2R alpha+NK cells and enhanced NK cell activation. The observed association between early life development of intestinal microbiota and immune system indicates possibilities to apply microbiota-targeted strategies that can accelerate maturation of intestinal microbiota and strengthen the immune system, thereby improving the health and resilience of broiler chickens.","2020-11-19","2022-06-27 16:29:16","2022-06-30 19:10:28","","","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Type: Article","","","","16S sequencing; biome-poultry gut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
